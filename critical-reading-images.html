What’s a Critique?Read and analyze the information below then then summarize it using any of the summarizing techniques you have learned in Module 2. Use a separate one wholesheet of paper. Critiques evaluate and analyse a good type of things (texts, images, performances, etc.) supported by reasons or criteria. Sometimes, people equate the notion of “critique” to “criticism”, which sometimes suggests negative interpretation. These terms are easy to confuse, but let us be clear that critique and criticize don’t mean the identical thing. A negative critique may be said to be criticism within the way we frequently understand the term “to criticize”, but critiques are often positive too. We are all conversant in one among the foremost basic styles of critique: reviews (film reviews, music reviews, art reviews, book reviews, etc). Critiques within the style of reviews tend to possess a reasonably simple and particular point: whether or not something is “good” or “bad”.My Summary​</a>

                                            DIRECTIONS: Read the following carefully. Write T if the statementis true and if the statement is false.1. Critique or review is a genre of academic writing which briefly summarizes andcritically evaluates a work or concept.2. Writing a critique on a work helps us to develop a fault-finding ability within one'sself.3. Critiques can be used to carefully analyze a variety of works such as novels,exhibite, film, images, poetry, monographs, journal articles, systematic reviews, theories,news reports, feature articles, and the like.4. Critical approaches sometimes called lenses, are different perspectives we canconsider when looking at a piece or several pieces of work.5. Feminism examines a literary work in terms of its form and lernents likecharacters, setting, plot, point-of-view, theme, symbolism, figures of speech, etc.6. Pormalism focuses on socio-economic status or on the unequal distribution ofwealth and resources between rich and poor.7. Reader response approach focuses on the discrimination, unequal treatment, andprejudices of women in the society,8. Marxism approach allows the writer to give his or her own assumptions orreactions on the event seen or article read.9. The purpose of critical approaches is to help us answer questions, as well ashelping us interpret and understand a variety of works.10. One of the reasons in writing critique is to recognize the strengths andweaknesses of the work.​</a>

Use a separate one wholesheet of paper.Critiques evaluate and analyse a good type of things (texts, images, performances, etc.) supported by reasons or criteria. Sometimes, people equate the notion of “critique” to “criticism”, which sometimes suggests negative interpretation. These terms are easy to confuse, but let us be clear that critique and criticize don’t mean the identical thing. A negative critique may be said to be criticism within the way we frequently understand the term “to criticize”, but critiques are often positive too. We are all conversant in one among the foremost basic styles of critique: reviews (film reviews, music reviews, art reviews, book reviews, etc). Critiques within the style of reviews tend to possess a reasonably simple and particular point: whether or not something is “good” or “bad”.My Summary​</a>

Selfies represent the beginning of the twenty-first century. The cultural moment of selfies will pass and be replaced by something iconic and phenomenal of our time, just as photographic self-portraits, painting self-portraits, and religious records were the selfies of their time. Culture of the Selfie is an in-depth art-historical outline of self-portraiture that employs theories from visual studies, narratology, and cultural studies. Popular culture is defined in a variety of ways, both implicit and explicit. The majority of concepts are contradictory and can lead to confusion. The 'Selfie' has gradually want to be an important artifact in contemporary pop culture theory. Selfie’ it could be suggested that ones’ perception of self-significance is being stated with each posting. This could take us into a deeper study of self-identity. As we an//alyse popular culture emerge in social media, it is clear that social networking affects our lives in a variety of ways, which include correspondence, self-expression, communicating with peers, and even our own sense of self-esteem. Even though social networking has improved greatly communication on a large and global scale, it does not excuse itself from being a totally positive mode of communication. From the sticks in the caves, to hieroglyphs, to books, to paintings, to analog pictures and to digital arts, it is a preservation of our historical part in humanity. Looking back at art history, Selfies are not the only self-expression but one of the know selfies are from Van-Gogh's own portrait. The self-expression of humanity is innate to our culture. It is a medium to exist, to be know to exist, and to make a mark. When we look at selfies, they are a comical part of our lives.
