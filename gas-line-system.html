Filters air of irritants,8. Induced by an allergic reaction or environmentalfactor.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. <strong>Trachea</strong> - The windpipe (trachea) is the largest airway. The trachea branches into two smaller airways: the left and right bronchi, which lead to the two lungs.</p><p></p><p>2. <strong>Larynx</strong> - The larynx is the upper opening into the windpipe (trachea), the passageway to the lungs.</p><p></p><p>3. <strong>Aveoli</strong><strong> </strong>- The alveoli are the functional units of the lungs and they form the site of gaseous exchange.</p><p></p><p>4. <strong>Oxygen</strong><strong> </strong>- Gas exchange takes place in the millions of alveoli in the lungs and the capillaries that envelop them. As shown below, inhaled oxygen moves from the alveoli to the blood in the capillaries, and carbon dioxide moves from the blood in the capillaries to the air in the alveoli. </p><p></p><p>5. The trachea, commonly known as the windpipe, is a tube about 4 inches long and less than an inch in diameter in most people. The trachea begins just under the larynx (voice box) and runs down behind the breastbone (sternum). The trachea then divides into two smaller tubes called bronchi: one bronchus for each lung.</p><p></p><p>6. <strong>Emphysema</strong> - Emphysema, also called pulmonary emphysema, condition characterized by widespread destruction of the gas-exchanging tissues of the lungs, resulting in abnormally large air spaces. ... In addition, loss of elastic tissue from the walls of the destroyed alveoli causes the lungs to expand within the chest cage. </p><p></p><p>7. Tiny hairs called cilia (SIL-ee-uh) protect the nasal passageways and other parts of the respiratory tract, filtering out dust and other particles that enter the nose through the breathed air. ... The trachea, or windpipe, is the continuation of the airway below the larynx</p><p></p><p>8. Among the most extensively studied environmental factors influencing allergy are airborne allergens: dust mites, pollens, fungi and animal dander. Foods may elicit both true IgE-mediated allergy and also various non-immunological reactions, associated with direct release of mediators or toxic activity.</p><br />

Collection of magma underneath the volcano forms hot bubblingenfurnace called magma chamber.107. Sulfur Dioxide, Hydrogen Chloride and Hydrogen Fluoride are thethree volcanic gases that pose the greatest potential hazard topeople and animals.8. Volcanic ash is the smallest tephra fragments.9. Volcanic ash can lead daylight into darkness.10. Landslides are large, massive of rocks and soil that fall slide veryrapidly under the force of gravity.​</h2><br />

                            28. ACT. 1 Kinetic Molecular TheoryDirections: Write TRUE if the statement is accurate and FALSE if the statement is flawed. 1. The particles are in constant, random, and straight-line motion. 2. The attractive forces among particles are negligible. _3. The average kinetic energy of the gas particles is equal to the absolute temperature. 4. The collision of the particles with each other and with the walls of the container changes the kinetic energy of the particles. 5. The particles of a gas are separated by distances much larger than their size. 6. The gas particle occupies a negligible volume. 7. Collisions among molecules are perfectly inelastic. _8. After each collision, the total energy of the system is the same. 9. The repulsive forces among particles are negligible. 10. At higher temperatures, the collision of the gas particles with the walls of the container becomes more often and with moreforce, thus producing a lesser pressure. ​.</h2><br />
