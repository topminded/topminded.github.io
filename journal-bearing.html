                                            This activity is an imitation of carrying around emotions such as anger and
unforgiveness in your heart by putting heavy objects into a sack such as rocks or large
books with labels such as hurt, resentment, hate, revenge, anger, and bitterness
Carry the sack for 5 minutes and after that, reflect and write in your journal what you
have felt and realized after carrying those rocks or large books.
Reflect that carrying around feelings such as anger and unforgiveness in your
heart is an even heavier load to bear than carrying the heavy sack. Imagine if you
choose to forgive the person who hurt you or offended you in some way, then all the
bad feelings disappear, and you will be free of the burden of carrying them around.
Remember that you are the one who will be hurt the most when you choose not to
forgive.</a>

                                            Earth bears many minerals which play a major role in our daily lives. Lookaround the room and you'll see many objects that are metal. We mine Earth's oredeposits to make iron, copper, aluminum, and other metals. Mineral fuels, such ascoal, give us energy to heat, air condition, light up and electrify our homes, offices,and factories. Minerals are also mined for stone products to make concrete, brickand glass for our buildings, roads, and playgrounds. And a broad assortment ofEarth's minerals goes into paper, paint, plastics, chemicals, filters, films, fertilizers,and many other products. In your journal or notebook, write a poem, song or aparagraph description that summarizes the importance of minerals in our daily lives.Different minerals are important for different purposes.

What makes an effective leader? To be sure, no one characteristic or trait defines an effective leader. It is true, however, that effective leaders get the most out of employees or group members by holding them to very high standards or expectations. Setting high standards increases productivity because people tend to live up to the expectations set for them by superiors. This is an example of the Pygmalion effect, which works in a subtle,
often unconscious way. When a managerial leader believes that a group member will succeed, the manager communicates this belief without realizing that he or she is doing so. Conversely, when a leader expects a group member to fail, that person will not usually disappoint the manager. The manager’s expectation of success or failure becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Thus it pays for a manager to expect the best from employees. 
(Adaptedfrom Andrew J. DuBrin, Leadership 4/e, © Cengage Learning.)

A. Called the “Pygmalion effect” i.e. expect the best and you'll get it
B. People are likely to live up to a manager's or superior's expectations
C. Effective leaders encourage a high level of performance by expecting the best from their employees
D. Leader who expects the best gets high achievement
Those cuddly stuffed animals called teddy bears seem to have been around forever. But actually the first teddy bears came into being when President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt showed himself too much of a sportsman to shoot a staked bear cub. In 1902, Roosevelt visited Mississippi to settle a border dispute. In Roosevelt’s honor, his hosts organized a hunting expedition. To make sure that the president would bag a trophy, they staked a bear
cub to the ground so that Roosevelt’s shot couldn’t miss. To his credit, Roosevelt refused to shoot the bear. When the incident was publicized, largely through political cartoons, a Russian candy store owner named Morris Michtom made a toy bear out of soft, fuzzy cloth and placed it in his shop window with a sign reading “Teddy’s Bear.” The bear was a hit with passersby, and teddy-bear mania spread rapidly throughout the country. Soon, Teddy's bear was the country's most popular toy, the teddy bear.

                            12. This activity is an imitation of carrying around emotions such as anger and
unforgiveness in your heart by putting heavy objects into a sack such as rocks or large
books with labels such as hurt, resentment, hate, revenge, anger, and bitterness
Carry the sack for 5 minutes and after that, reflect and write in your journal what you
have felt and realized after carrying those rocks or large books.
Reflect that carrying around feelings such as anger and unforgiveness in your
heart is an even heavier load to bear than carrying the heavy sack. Imagine if you
choose to forgive the person who hurt you or offended you in some way, then all the
bad feelings disappear, and you will be free of the burden of carrying them around.
Remember that you are the one who will be hurt the most when you choose not to
forgive.</h2><br />

What makes an effective leader? To be sure, no one characteristic or trait defines an effective leader. It is true, however, that effective leaders get the most out of employees or group members by holding them to very high standards or expectations. Setting high standards increases productivity because people tend to live up to the expectations set for them by superiors. This is an example of the Pygmalion effect, which works in a subtle,
often unconscious way. When a managerial leader believes that a group member will succeed, the manager communicates this belief without realizing that he or she is doing so. Conversely, when a leader expects a group member to fail, that person will not usually disappoint the manager. The manager’s expectation of success or failure becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Thus it pays for a manager to expect the best from employees. 
(Adaptedfrom Andrew J. DuBrin, Leadership 4/e, © Cengage Learning.)

B. People are likely to live up to a manager's or superior's expectations

D. Leader who expects the best gets high achievement
Those cuddly stuffed animals called teddy bears seem to have been around forever. But actually the first teddy bears came into being when President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt showed himself too much of a sportsman to shoot a staked bear cub. In 1902, Roosevelt visited Mississippi to settle a border dispute. In Roosevelt’s honor, his hosts organized a hunting expedition. To make sure that the president would bag a trophy, they staked a bear
cub to the ground so that Roosevelt’s shot couldn’t miss. To his credit, Roosevelt refused to shoot the bear. When the incident was publicized, largely through political cartoons, a Russian candy store owner named Morris Michtom made a toy bear out of soft, fuzzy cloth and placed it in his shop window with a sign reading “Teddy’s Bear.” The bear was a hit with passersby, and teddy-bear mania spread rapidly throughout the country. Soon, Teddy's bear was the country's most popular toy, the teddy bear.
