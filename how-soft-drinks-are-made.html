There is a ritual or repeated process of celebrating Christmas in the Philippines, what are these and how are they portrayed in media. Answer the following questions: 1. Identify some of the practices you and your family experience during the Christmas season. 2. How similar or different is your celebration or practice from those of your friend/ classmate? In what ways are they the same? In what ways are they different? 3. Look for a Filipino Christmas advertisement on YouTube (tip: try soft drinks, hams, and pasta products). Compare how your celebration at home is the same or different from that portrayed on the ad. 4. Reflecting on the Principles above, how does this ad make you feel now? Explain what you're feeling in 3-5 sentences. Cite specific instances, if possible, of how the advertising made you feel a certain way.​</a>

To begin with hard candy is a alcoholic and non-alcoholic Alcoholic drinks type of candy that is made out of melted sugary ingredients but then later is left to cool and harden. For example, you are spints, wine, beer Non-alcoholic drinks can find mints, toffee, Lifesavers that are all types of hard candy. In addition, chocolate is a wonderful type of candy may be sub-divided into hot drinks and cold that uses cocoa beans. There are many kinds, for instance, Mars Bar, Oh Henry, and Caramilk.

Each colony has one The classic form of food poisoning is caused by female queen bee, ten of thousands of workers and a few staphylococo (bacteria commonly known as staph). The hundred male bees or drones. Honey bees lives in hives Inside their hive, the bees make a honeycomb of wax. The staph germs enter the food during preparation. As a result of honey comb is a kind of bee apartment building full of six- the food not properly refrigerated the bacteria multiply sided room sin which the bees raises young and store food. hourly, contaminating the food with toxin (poison). As staph The queen bee lays thousands of eggs. Worms look like germs and their toxins are odourless and tasteless the larvae hatch from eggs. Each larva becomes a pupa, vich contaminated food smells and tastes normal. locks partly take larva and partly like an adult bee. Worker Eating contaminated food causes vomiting, abdominal bees feed the young .clean, guard the tive, and fly to and from flowers. They collect tiny grairs of pollen and a sweet cramps and diarrhoea within one to six hours. liquid caled nectar for food. The pollen is food for young Thus, food poisoning is frequently caused by bees. Worker bees use the nectar to make honey Without Staphylococci, which contaminate food during preparation bees bringing pollen from lower to Power, many plants can't and enter the stomach and intestines during eating. 2. 5. make seeds Walls are built for different purposes.

A few hours after the man was admitted in the hospital, his skin started develop a yellowish discoloration. On the next day, the man died. It should be noted that the man was very healthy and free of illness a day before he was admitted to the hospital. An trivestigation was made on the cause of his death. The autopsy revealed that he died of a severe viral infection that is carried by rats. Investigators also found out that he consumed a can of softdnnk prior to developing the deadly symptoms, Health authorilis was able to trace the store where the man bought the softdrink. The store was clean and did follow proper hygiene procedures. However, when the storage area was checked. It was dark and had many rats running on top of uncovered soft drink cans.1.

                        <strong>TLE</strong><p><strong>1. Identify some of the practices you and your family experience during the Christmas season.</strong></p><p>One of the practices my family and I experience during the Christmas season is attending Simbang Gabi or Misa de Gallo, which is a nine-day novena mass that starts on December 16 and culminates on Christmas Eve. We also put up Christmas decorations like parols (star-shaped lanterns), Christmas lights, and belens (nativity scenes). On Christmas day, we usually have a big feast with traditional Filipino dishes like lechon (roasted pig), hamon (ham), and bibingka (rice cake).</p><p></p><p><strong>2. How similar or different is your celebration or practice from those of your friend/ classmate? In what ways are they the same? In what ways are they different?</strong></p><p>My celebration and practices during Christmas are quite similar to those of my friends/classmates. We also attend Simbang Gabi, put up Christmas decorations, and have a big feast on Christmas day. However, there may be differences in the specific dishes we prepare or the way we decorate our homes.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. Look for a Filipino Christmas advertisement on YouTube (tip: try soft drinks, hams, and pasta products). Compare how your celebration at home is the same or different from that portrayed on the ad.</strong></p><p>Not to mention the brand but I found a Filipino Christmas advertisement on YouTube for a well-known brand of ham. The ad featured a family preparing for Christmas and highlighted the importance of spending time with loved ones during the holidays. The family was shown decorating their home, cooking Christmas dinner, and sharing a meal together.</p><p>(Eden Cheese is the brand)</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>4. Reflecting on the Principles above, how does this ad make you feel now? Explain what you're feeling in 3-5 sentences. Cite specific instances, if possible, of how the advertising made you feel a certain way.​</strong></p><p>The advertisement made me feel happy and nostalgic. Seeing the family in the ad reminded me of my own family's Christmas traditions and the joy of being together during the holiday season. The ad was effective in evoking emotions and portraying the importance of family and togetherness during Christmas. One specific instance that made me feel a certain way was when the family was shown exchanging gifts, which reminded me of the joy of giving and receiving gifts during Christmas. Overall, the ad was successful in capturing the essence of Filipino Christmas traditions.</p><br />
