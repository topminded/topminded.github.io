                                            Case Questions:
 Using a visual metaphor to indicate brand functionality may seem a simple
solution to a communications challenge. Can you guess what prior cultural

 Collect examples of five ads that deploy visual metaphors. Do they all use them
in the same way? Can you think of any product categories or markets in which
visual metaphors would not be useful? Why?
Some of the most troubling challenges facing account teams concern mundane
products with a largely functional appeal. In what ways was this agency able to
invest brand values in the product through its choice of creative execution?</a>

                                            what is the main idea below.
- Many learners and teachers have established a wide range of
activities to support approaches to creativity and exploit the features of digital
technologies in processes such as: (a)developing ideas: supporting imaginative
conjecture, exploration and representation of ideas; (b) making connections:
supporting, challenging, informing and developing ideas by making
connections within formation, people, projects and resources; (c) creating and
making: engaging in making meanings though fashioning processes of
capture, manipulation and transformation of media; (d) collaboration:
working with others in immediate and dynamic ways to collaborate on
outcomes and construct shared knowledge; (e) communication and
evaluation: publishing and communicating outcomes for evaluation and
critique from a range of audiences. These activities are not always discrete or
sequential and there can be synchronicity in their expression and overlap of
applications for different purposes. Examples of such activities range from
using simulations and adventure games to explore the question ‘what would
happen if…?’, to publishing hypertext stories or constructing avatars to meet
and interact in three-dimensional, virtual worlds. This wealth of activity
illustrates how children and young people are able to use ICT to demonstrate
creative characteristics in the interaction between people and processes in
subject areas which are authentic, relevant and challenging</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a community organizer or facilitator in Pope Francis Village, you might encounter the following challenges:</p><p></p><p>- Resistance to change: One challenge you may face is resistance to change. The community members may have their own set of beliefs and practices that they have been following for years. Introducing new ideas and practices may be met with skepticism or even hostility. To overcome this challenge, you need to take time to build trust and relationships with the community members. Involve them in the decision-making process and explain the benefits of the changes you are proposing.</p><p></p><p>- Limited resources: Another challenge you may face is limited resources. Pope Francis Village may be located in an area with limited access to basic needs such as water, electricity, and healthcare. This can make it challenging to implement community programs and activities. To overcome this challenge, you need to be creative and resourceful. Find ways to work with what you have, and collaborate with other organizations or individuals who can provide additional resources.</p><p></p><p>- Cultural differences: Finally, cultural differences may also pose a challenge. Pope Francis Village may be home to people from different cultural backgrounds, each with their own set of values and beliefs. This can lead to misunderstandings  and conflicts. To overcome this challenge, you need to be respectful of different cultures and practices. Work to build understanding and foster a sense of community that celebrates diversity. Encourage dialogue and mutual respect among community members.</p><br />

                            15. what is the main idea below.
- Many learners and teachers have established a wide range of
activities to support approaches to creativity and exploit the features of digital
technologies in processes such as: (a)developing ideas: supporting imaginative
conjecture, exploration and representation of ideas; (b) making connections:
supporting, challenging, informing and developing ideas by making
connections within formation, people, projects and resources; (c) creating and
making: engaging in making meanings though fashioning processes of
capture, manipulation and transformation of media; (d) collaboration:
working with others in immediate and dynamic ways to collaborate on
outcomes and construct shared knowledge; (e) communication and
evaluation: publishing and communicating outcomes for evaluation and
critique from a range of audiences. These activities are not always discrete or
sequential and there can be synchronicity in their expression and overlap of
applications for different purposes. Examples of such activities range from
using simulations and adventure games to explore the question ‘what would
happen if…?’, to publishing hypertext stories or constructing avatars to meet
and interact in three-dimensional, virtual worlds. This wealth of activity
illustrates how children and young people are able to use ICT to demonstrate
creative characteristics in the interaction between people and processes in
subject areas which are authentic, relevant and challenging</h2><br />

An example is provided in each box. (10 minutes)During the course of the conduct of research, common difficulties may arise that will greatly affect the result of your research. As a researcher, one must be adept enough to foresee possible challenges to your research so that it will be resolved sooner.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Lack of standardization in the research process for distance education research. There are logistical issues surrounding the research process that need to be addressed. Oftentimes what seems like a streamlined process on paper does not necessarily pan out as such in actual implementation. DETA researchers expressed a top challenge for distance education research is translating the research plan into actual implementation at the designing stage, data collection stage, and analysis stage for distance education studies.
Incentivizing participation. Many distance education researchers face the obstacle of finding enough faculty and student participants to warrant a sound, evidence-based research project. Given the economic climate influencing many institutional resources, monetary incentives are unlikely, or the incentivization results in minimal participation. Thus, researchers face the difficulty of finding creative strategies for encouraging participation with limited resources.
Reliance on self-reported data. As with any research endeavor involving opinions and behaviors of humans, reliance on self-reported data means our data is ‘as good as the responses we ask for.’ The accuracy of self-reported data, without the availability of data for cross-checking, is unknown, which is a challenge in research conducted on student populations.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            27. Using a visual metaphor to indicate brand functionality may seem a simple
 solution to a communications challenge. Can you guess what prior cultural
 knowledge would be required for a consumer to fully understand the
 communication in the Advan’s campaign?
 2. Collect examples of five ads that deploy visual metaphors. Do they all use them
 in the same way? Can you think of any product categories or markets in which
 visual metaphors would not be useful? Why?
 3. Some of the most troubling challenges facing account teams concern mundane
 products with a largely functional appeal. In what ways was this agency able to
 invest brand values in the product through its choice of creative execution?</h2><br />
                        <p>1) Without knowing the specific Advan campaign, it is difficult to provide a concrete answer to this question. However, in general, the prior cultural knowledge required for a consumer to fully understand a visual metaphor used in a brand's communication would depend on the specific metaphor used, as well as the cultural context in which the communication is being received. For example, a visual metaphor that relies on a cultural reference or symbol that is only familiar to a specific group of people may not be fully understood by consumers outside of that group. In general, the more universal or widely recognized the metaphor, the more likely it is that consumers will understand its intended meaning.</p><p></p><p>2) Examples of ads that use visual metaphors:</p>Apple's "Think Different" campaign, which used imagery of iconic figures like Albert Einstein and Martin Luther King Jr. to communicate the idea of innovation and creativity.Coca-Cola's "Share a Coke" campaign, which used personalized labels with people's names on them to encourage social connection and sharing.Nike's "Just Do It" campaign, which used imagery of athletes pushing themselves to their limits to communicate the idea of determination and perseverance.Volkswagen's "Think Small" campaign, which used a small car to challenge the idea that bigger is always better and appeal to consumers looking for practicality and efficiency.FedEx's "We Live to Deliver" campaign, which used a hidden arrow in the negative space between the letters "E" and "x" to communicate the idea of precision and attention to detail.<p>These examples all use visual metaphors in different ways, but all aim to communicate a key message or brand value through imagery.</p><p></p><p>There may be product categories or markets in which visual metaphors would not be useful, such as highly regulated industries where clear and direct messaging is required, or products that are not visually appealing or easily represented through imagery. However, in most cases, visual metaphors can be a powerful tool for communicating a brand's message and values.</p><p></p><p>3) Without knowing the specific agency or product being referred to, it is difficult to provide a specific answer to this question. However, in general, one way to invest brand values in a product with a largely functional appeal is to create a strong brand identity and narrative that resonates with consumers. This can involve using storytelling, humor, or emotional appeals to make the product more relatable and memorable. Additionally, creative execution can be used to highlight the unique features or benefits of the product in a way that is visually engaging and memorable. By creating a strong brand identity and narrative, and using creative execution to highlight the product's benefits, even a mundane product can become more interesting and appealing to consumers.</p><br />
