She said I could start by picking my dirty clothes and putting them in the laundry area where she washes our clothes every day. She also added that I could help her by peeling some vegetables she would use to cook our favorite food. My mother also asked me to clean and organize my toys in the cabinet, Mother also reminded me that before leaving the bedroom in the morning, I should fix our beddings. I also help my brother and sister in washing the dishes, and in preparing the table before and after meals. Even though I don't go to school every day, I still read my books and write something on my notes. I also draw and paint different animals, flowers, and superheroes that I see in my books. These are the things that I do every day to have fruitful quarantine days. Anor the following questions:​</a>

                                            How are you going to describe your family? What kind of parents, brothers and sisters do you have? Are you happy with the kind of life you have today? Will you consider your family rich or poor? Read the story carefully. The Two BrothersIn a barangay at Floridablanca, there was a fourteen-year-old Kapampangan boy named Samuel. He lived with his father, mother, and younger brother in a simple house with a big backyard full of vegetables and fruit-bearing trees. Samuel was an industrious boy. In the morning, he cleaned the backyard and helped his father in harvesting some vegetables and fruits. He helped his mother in preparing their meals, too. Aside from being industrious, he was also smart and responsible. Since the quarantine period started, he spent his time drawing and reading books. He also used DepEd Commons and answered most of the questions in the activities correctly. He knew and he followed the things he should and should not do. He just stayed home. Carlos, Samuel’s brother who is two years younger than him, was very different.  He was lazy. He did not like helping their father nor their mother in any of the household chores. When COVID 19 broke out, Carlos consumed almost of his time playing mobile games. He was negligent of himself. At times, he skipped his meals because he slept late at night and got up late in the morning. He was stubborn. There were times when he secretly went out of their house to meet his friends. One day, Carlos felt sick. He had headache and cough. He also felt really tired. Since the two brothers shared a room, their parents told Samuel to stay and sleep in the living room for the mean time. Their parents confiscated Carlos’ cellular phone and instructed him to have enough rest. Samuel and his parents took care of Carlos. Their parents fed him with nutritious food. Samuel gave his brother enough water and vitamins to take. They also knelt together and asked the Almighty to heal Carlos. The next day just as when their parents were about to report Carlos’ case to the barangay health workers, Carlos went out of the room looking perfectly fine. He did not have any headache nor cough anymore. He did not feel tired anymore. He felt stronger and healthier than before. Carlos looked at his family with teary eyes and said, “Dacal a salamat kekayu. Pasensiya na kayu at megi kung pasaway.” NOTE: If the learner is with a guardian, discuss the following questions together. If the learner is accomplishing the module alone, he will reflect on the following:1. Who are the characters in the story? 2. What can you say about Samuel? 3. What can you say about Carlos? 4. What can you say about their parents? Are yours the same? In what way? 5. Where did the story take place? 6. Is the family rich or poor? Prove your answer. ​</a>

Will you consider your family rich or poor? Read the story carefully. The Two BrothersIn a barangay at Floridablanca, there was a fourteen-year-old Kapampangan boy named Samuel. He lived with his father, mother, and younger brother in a simple house with a big backyard full of vegetables and fruit-bearing trees. Samuel was an industrious boy. In the morning, he cleaned the backyard and helped his father in harvesting some vegetables and fruits. He helped his mother in preparing their meals, too. Aside from being industrious, he was also smart and responsible. Since the quarantine period started, he spent his time drawing and reading books. He also used DepEd Commons and answered most of the questions in the activities correctly. He knew and he followed the things he should and should not do. He just stayed home. Carlos, Samuel’s brother who is two years younger than him, was very different.  He was lazy. He did not like helping their father nor their mother in any of the household chores. When COVID 19 broke out, Carlos consumed almost of his time playing mobile games. He was negligent of himself. At times, he skipped his meals because he slept late at night and got up late in the morning. He was stubborn. There were times when he secretly went out of their house to meet his friends. One day, Carlos felt sick. He had headache and cough. He also felt really tired. Since the two brothers shared a room, their parents told Samuel to stay and sleep in the living room for the mean time. Their parents confiscated Carlos’ cellular phone and instructed him to have enough rest. Samuel and his parents took care of Carlos. Their parents fed him with nutritious food. Samuel gave his brother enough water and vitamins to take. They also knelt together and asked the Almighty to heal Carlos. The next day just as when their parents were about to report Carlos’ case to the barangay health workers, Carlos went out of the room looking perfectly fine. He did not have any headache nor cough anymore. He did not feel tired anymore. He felt stronger and healthier than before. Carlos looked at his family with teary eyes and said, “Dacal a salamat kekayu. Pasensiya na kayu at megi kung pasaway.” NOTE: If the learner is with a guardian, discuss the following questions together. If the learner is accomplishing the module alone, he will reflect on the following:1. Who are the characters in the story? 2. What can you say about Samuel? 3. What can you say about Carlos? 4. What can you say about their parents? Are yours the same? In what way? 5. Where did the story take place? 6. Is the family rich or poor? Prove your answer. ​</h2><br />

NOTE: <strong>Draw paper and fabric</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Different materials have different properties. These <strong>properties are characteristics that distinguished one material from other materials</strong>. Examples of these are malleability, boiling point, solubility, and phase. <strong>A change in these properties is referred to as changes of matter</strong>. It can be a physical change or a chemical change. <strong>Physical change is a change in the form of material without changing the identity and chemical composition of the material.</strong> Examples of this are cutting of paper, slicing of bread, bending of wire, and phase change. <strong>Chemical change</strong>, on the other hand, i<strong>s a kind of change wherein the composition, structure, or composition changes.</strong> There is a chemical reaction involved wherein atoms are rearranged and the bonds between atoms either are broken or formed. <strong>In a chemical change, a new substance is formed</strong> that is totally different from the original substance. Some of the indicators that a chemical change took place are the formation of precipitate or gas, production of odor, and change of temperature. Examples of chemical change are burning of paper, decomposition, digestion, and cooking. </p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST</p><p></p><br />
