                                            The study was conducted in the secondary schools in Nigeria. To guide the investigation the researcher raised research question and formulated onehypothesis in the study. A sample of fifty-six schools was selected from a total population of 278 schools in the Delta North Senatorial District through the stratified random technique. In these fifty-six schools, there was a total of 5,315 staff from which respondents were drawn. Twenty per cent of the targetpopulation was the subject of the study.A questionnaire was used in collecting data which were analyzed using percentage and Z-test statistic. The result of the findings revealed that humanresources undergo different forms of training. The result also revealed that there is a significance difference between the performances of human resourcesin relation to students' academic performance. It was therefore concluded that school personnel should undergo training and attend regular workshops and seminars. Also that the performances of human resources have considerable effects on students' academic performance. The researcher thereforerecommended that the human resources in schools who are not trained professional staff should be advised to go for Post Graduate Diploma in Education to acquire teaching skills. They should be made to understand the importance of appropriate teaching methods for specific subject areas as they help thestaff perform more effectively1. What was investigated?a.

                                            make your own news report in a video presentationMany urban communities are now besieged by illegal drugs. Fears of gang violence and muggings keep frightened residents at home. Even at home, citizens feel insecure, for drug-related break-ins and burglaries threaten. Open dealing on the street stirs the community's fears for its children. The police sometimes seem overwhelmed. Occasionally they are outgunned. More often, they are simply overmatched by the resilience of the drug commerce. Furthermore, their potential impact is neutralized by the incapacity of the courts and penal system to mete out deserved punishments. Urgent problems and limited resources demand managerial thought for their resolution. Thus, police executives facing the drug problem might usefully consider four strategic questions: What goals might reasonably be set for drug enforcement? What parts of the police department engage the drug problem and to what effect? What role can citizens and community groups usefully (and properly) play in coping with the problem? What basic strategies might the police department consider as alternative attacks on the problem? The goals of drug enforcement From a police chief's perspective, the drug problem presents distinguishable threats to community security. Most pressing is the violence associated with street-level drug dealing-This is one in a series of reports originally developed with some of the leading figures in American policing during their periodic meetings at Hanard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. The reports are published so that Americans interested in the improvement and the future of policing can share in the information and perspectives that were part of extensive debates at the School's Executive Session on Policing. The police chiefs, mayors, scholars, and others invited to the meetings have focused on the use and promise of such strategies as community-based and problem-oriented policing. The testing and adoption of these strategies by some police agencies signal important changes in the way American policing now does business. What these changes mean for the welfare of citizens and the fulfillment of the police mission in the next decades has been at the heart of the Kennedy School meetings and this series of papers. We hope that through these publications police officials and other policymakers who affect the course of policing will debate and challenge their beliefs just as those of us in the Executive Session have done. The Executive Session on Policing has been developed and administered by the Kennedy School's Program in Criminal Justice Policy and Management and funded by the National Institute of Justice and private sources that include the Charles Stewart Mott and Guggenheim Foundations.

                            2. The study was conducted in the secondary schools in Nigeria. To guide the investigation the researcher raised research question and formulated onehypothesis in the study. A sample of fifty-six schools was selected from a total population of 278 schools in the Delta North Senatorial District through the stratified random technique. In these fifty-six schools, there was a total of 5,315 staff from which respondents were drawn. Twenty per cent of the targetpopulation was the subject of the study.A questionnaire was used in collecting data which were analyzed using percentage and Z-test statistic. The result of the findings revealed that humanresources undergo different forms of training. The result also revealed that there is a significance difference between the performances of human resourcesin relation to students' academic performance. It was therefore concluded that school personnel should undergo training and attend regular workshops and seminars. Also that the performances of human resources have considerable effects on students' academic performance. The researcher thereforerecommended that the human resources in schools who are not trained professional staff should be advised to go for Post Graduate Diploma in Education to acquire teaching skills. They should be made to understand the importance of appropriate teaching methods for specific subject areas as they help thestaff perform more effectively1. What was investigated?a.

                            5. make your own news report in a video presentationMany urban communities are now besieged by illegal drugs. Fears of gang violence and muggings keep frightened residents at home. Even at home, citizens feel insecure, for drug-related break-ins and burglaries threaten. Open dealing on the street stirs the community's fears for its children. The police sometimes seem overwhelmed. Occasionally they are outgunned. More often, they are simply overmatched by the resilience of the drug commerce. Furthermore, their potential impact is neutralized by the incapacity of the courts and penal system to mete out deserved punishments. Urgent problems and limited resources demand managerial thought for their resolution. Thus, police executives facing the drug problem might usefully consider four strategic questions: What goals might reasonably be set for drug enforcement? What parts of the police department engage the drug problem and to what effect? What role can citizens and community groups usefully (and properly) play in coping with the problem? What basic strategies might the police department consider as alternative attacks on the problem? The goals of drug enforcement From a police chief's perspective, the drug problem presents distinguishable threats to community security. Most pressing is the violence associated with street-level drug dealing-This is one in a series of reports originally developed with some of the leading figures in American policing during their periodic meetings at Hanard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. The reports are published so that Americans interested in the improvement and the future of policing can share in the information and perspectives that were part of extensive debates at the School's Executive Session on Policing. The police chiefs, mayors, scholars, and others invited to the meetings have focused on the use and promise of such strategies as community-based and problem-oriented policing. The testing and adoption of these strategies by some police agencies signal important changes in the way American policing now does business. What these changes mean for the welfare of citizens and the fulfillment of the police mission in the next decades has been at the heart of the Kennedy School meetings and this series of papers. We hope that through these publications police officials and other policymakers who affect the course of policing will debate and challenge their beliefs just as those of us in the Executive Session have done. The Executive Session on Policing has been developed and administered by the Kennedy School's Program in Criminal Justice Policy and Management and funded by the National Institute of Justice and private sources that include the Charles Stewart Mott and Guggenheim Foundations.
