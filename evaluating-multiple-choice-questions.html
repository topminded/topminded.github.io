Cheryl writes 7 fewer posts than Kevin on a social media site.
Answer the questions to write an algebraic expression. Then evaluate the expression for the given value.
1. Choose a variable to represent the number of posts Kevin writes.
variable: x
2. Which operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) applies to this situation? Justify your choice.
Subtraction
Cheryl’s post is less than Kevin’s
3. Use your variable and the operation you identified to write an expression for the number of posts Cheryl wrote.
Cheryl’s number of posts: x - 7
4. If Kevin wrote 21 posts, how many did Cheryl write?
x = 21
So, Cheryl’s post should be 21 - 7

Cheryl writes 7 fewer posts than Kevin on a social media site.
Answer the questions to write an algebraic expression. Then evaluate the expression for the given value.
1. Choose a variable to represent the number of posts Kevin writes.
variable: x
2. Which operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) applies to this situation? Justify your choice.
Subtraction
Cheryl’s post is less than Kevin’s
3. Use your variable and the operation you identified to write an expression for the number of posts Cheryl wrote.
Cheryl’s number of posts: x - 7
4. If Kevin wrote 21 posts, how many did Cheryl write?
x = 21
So, Cheryl’s post should be 21 - 7
