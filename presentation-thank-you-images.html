Choose the right term from the pool of answers and write the letter of your choice on your answer sheet First two answers are already provided. "TRESPASSING COULD COST YOU MORE THAN A $200 FINE. STAY OF THE TRACKS"-poster1. high-angled shot2. colours 3. symbolic 4. pun 5. slogan 6.image 7. framing 8. language 9. font 10. frame 11. side lighting 12. "penalty" 13. composition 14. Gaze 15. salient -numbers 1 to 15 are the choicesslogan In this poster we are presented with a highly emotive black and white 1.imageol a young man holding towards the camera his right arm, which has been amputated below the elbow. Below the photograph, on a contrasting orange, red and yellow background is a pun "Trespassing could cost you more than a $200 fine.' At the foot of the poster the crossed railway tracks become a symbolic cross, signifying death, and together with the imperative Stay off the tracks, and slogan "There's no good reason for you to be on the tracks. The penalty is $200 or your life' bring across a strong message for the Transperth and Public Transport Authority WA railway campaign.The oblique, slightly 2.___high-angled shot focuses on es faci expression, but the stump is more satient by being deliberately placed closest to the viewer. His face, un smiling, is lit by 3.___and surrounded by shadow. His nakedness suggests vulnerability but his facial expression could also suggest that he is accepting of the loss and feel comfortable enough to display it to a wider audience. He is not looking at the viewer, but away into the distance-an uverted Gaze. This allows the4.___ to be non-confrontational - as the viewer we are able to look at liis injury with curiosity or pity or whatever emotions we feel and noticel guilty for judging bi or examining the stump closely. There is a sense of Direct Chaze as he wants 18 to look all his urn. The shadow is in subtle 5.___around the vicum By viewing the person, not just the amputation, it is more real, more human and we realize that accidents like this do happen. The bright omnge, red and yellow6.___of thic background provide contrast to the photograph above, but they also add weight to achieve balance willing the poster The 7.___of the poster relies on the golden rectangle or the golden ratio that is visually or aesthetically pleasing The photograph, although smaller than the much larger contrasting section is chic more 8.___ in terms of the composition. The emphasis and unpact lic with the photograph. The colors are 9.___of langer and there is deliberate 10.___ with the red-orange around the care of the yellow center. The yellow, usually associated with happiness, draws attention to the symbolic railway cross at its heart. The use of space between the pan and the cross helps the viewer to glean several messages from the poster. The bold black capitalized font of the 11___is centered. The use of the capitalized 12.___which is more difficult to read than lower case, makes us concentrate on what the punis saying, as we make links to the image above The 13.___devices used in the poster are clear in their message.The pun is less direct than other examples of language used as it requires some thinking and linking between the image and language. The two meanings of cost' refer to a financial cost of $200 but more importantly, the physical and emotional impact of the loss of a limb or (as another link is made to the symbolic railway cross) ultimately the loss of life. The use of the personal pronoun "you" directly targets the viewer and the imperative commands the vicwer to "Stay of the tracks' The 14.___ while having a colloquial lone, reiterates the ultimatum to the viewer, with "The penalty is $200 or your life" The use of 15.___ here seems almost an understatement when referring to the loss of life.uhm i will accept 2 dares sa magsagot ng matino, thanks. ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>ACTIVITY 1: COUNSELING ACTIVITY</strong></p><p>Counseling is a process of helping individuals, couples, families, or groups to address their personal, social, or emotional issues, and find solutions to their problems. It involves building a therapeutic relationship with the client and providing them with support, guidance, and advice to help them make positive changes in their lives. Counseling activity may include various techniques such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, psychoanalytic therapy, solution-focused therapy, and humanistic therapy, among others.</p><p><strong>ACTIVITY 2: ROLES OF COUNSELING</strong></p>Provides emotional | Teaches coping | Gives specific support, empathy, | strategies and | guidance and and validation to | life skills | advice on what to the client to | to help manage | do in specific help them manage | challenges | situations their emotions and feelings.Helps clients | Provides | Gives homework gain insight into | information and | assignments or their problems | resources on | exercises to and develop self- | different | practice skills awareness and | issues related | and strategies to self-acceptance. | to the client's | improve their | situation.Provides a safe | Encourages | Sets goals and and non-judgmental | and supports | objectives for space for clients | clients in | clients to work to express their | making positive | towards, and thoughts and | changes and | monitors their feelings without | developing | progress, fear of criticism new skills.<p><strong>ACTIVITY 3: MY ROLE AS A COUNSELOR</strong></p>Elsa's problem is low self-esteem and lack of confidence.To tackle Elsa's problem, the counselor can use techniques such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or humanistic therapy to help Elsa identify and challenge negative thoughts and beliefs about herself. The counselor can help Elsa set achievable goals and celebrate small successes to boost her self-esteem. The counselor can also encourage Elsa to participate in activities that she enjoys and are good at, which can help her build a positive self-image.As a guidance counselor, the first step in intervening in Ralph's absences would be to talk to him and try to understand the reason behind his absences. The counselor can explore whether there are any personal or family issues that are affecting Ralph's attendance. The counselor can also work with the teacher and the parents to create a plan to improve Ralph's attendance, such as setting specific attendance goals or providing additional support to Ralph. The counselor can also provide Ralph with information and resources on the importance of attendance and its impact on academic performance. Finally, the counselor can encourage Ralph to take responsibility for his attendance and help him develop strategies to manage his time better and prioritize his school attendance.<p></p><p></p><p>ACTIVITY 1: COUNSELING CORNER</p><p></p><p>Counseling is a process of helping individuals deal with their personal, social, and emotional issues. It involves a professional relationship between a counselor and a client, where the counselor provides guidance, support, and interventions to help the client achieve their goals, overcome their challenges, and improve their overall well-being.

As a counselor, I will use a client-centered approach to help Elsa build her self-esteem and develop a positive self-image. I will encourage her to explore her strengths and talents and help her set achievable goals. I will also use cognitive-behavioral techniques to challenge her negative self-talk and teach her new coping skills. Additionally, I will create a safe and non-judgmental environment where Elsa can feel comfortable sharing her thoughts and feelings.</p><p></p><p>What will you do to intervene Ralph's absences? As a guidance counselor, I will first meet with Ralph to identify the reasons behind his absences. I will explore whether there are any underlying issues, such as anxiety, depression, or family problems, that may be contributing to his behavior. I will also work with Ralph's class adviser to develop a plan to improve his attendance, such as setting realistic goals and providing incentives for attendance. I may also involve Ralph's parents or other school staff members in the intervention process. Additionally, I will provide Ralph with resources and support to help him overcome any barriers that may be preventing him from attending school regularly.</p><p></p><br />

Choose the right term from the pool of answers and write the letter of your choice on your answer sheet First two answers are already provided. "TRESPASSING COULD COST YOU MORE THAN A $200 FINE. STAY OF THE TRACKS"-poster1. high-angled shot2. colours 3. symbolic 4. pun 5. slogan 6.image 7. framing 8. language 9. font 10. frame 11. side lighting 12. "penalty" 13. composition 14. Gaze 15. salient -numbers 1 to 15 are the choicesslogan In this poster we are presented with a highly emotive black and white 1.imageol a young man holding towards the camera his right arm, which has been amputated below the elbow. Below the photograph, on a contrasting orange, red and yellow background is a pun "Trespassing could cost you more than a $200 fine.' At the foot of the poster the crossed railway tracks become a symbolic cross, signifying death, and together with the imperative Stay off the tracks, and slogan "There's no good reason for you to be on the tracks. The penalty is $200 or your life' bring across a strong message for the Transperth and Public Transport Authority WA railway campaign.The oblique, slightly 2.___high-angled shot focuses on es faci expression, but the stump is more satient by being deliberately placed closest to the viewer. His face, un smiling, is lit by 3.___and surrounded by shadow. His nakedness suggests vulnerability but his facial expression could also suggest that he is accepting of the loss and feel comfortable enough to display it to a wider audience. He is not looking at the viewer, but away into the distance-an uverted Gaze. This allows the4.___ to be non-confrontational - as the viewer we are able to look at liis injury with curiosity or pity or whatever emotions we feel and noticel guilty for judging bi or examining the stump closely. There is a sense of Direct Chaze as he wants 18 to look all his urn. The shadow is in subtle 5.___around the vicum By viewing the person, not just the amputation, it is more real, more human and we realize that accidents like this do happen. The bright omnge, red and yellow6.___of thic background provide contrast to the photograph above, but they also add weight to achieve balance willing the poster The 7.___of the poster relies on the golden rectangle or the golden ratio that is visually or aesthetically pleasing The photograph, although smaller than the much larger contrasting section is chic more 8.___ in terms of the composition. The emphasis and unpact lic with the photograph. The colors are 9.___of langer and there is deliberate 10.___ with the red-orange around the care of the yellow center. The yellow, usually associated with happiness, draws attention to the symbolic railway cross at its heart. The use of space between the pan and the cross helps the viewer to glean several messages from the poster. The bold black capitalized font of the 11___is centered. The use of the capitalized 12.___which is more difficult to read than lower case, makes us concentrate on what the punis saying, as we make links to the image above The 13.___devices used in the poster are clear in their message.The pun is less direct than other examples of language used as it requires some thinking and linking between the image and language. The two meanings of cost' refer to a financial cost of $200 but more importantly, the physical and emotional impact of the loss of a limb or (as another link is made to the symbolic railway cross) ultimately the loss of life. The use of the personal pronoun "you" directly targets the viewer and the imperative commands the vicwer to "Stay of the tracks' The 14.___ while having a colloquial lone, reiterates the ultimatum to the viewer, with "The penalty is $200 or your life" The use of 15.___ here seems almost an understatement when referring to the loss of life.uhm i will accept 2 dares sa magsagot ng matino, thanks. ​</h2><br />
