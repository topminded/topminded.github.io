                                            “Lyrics: II (17)" By Jose Garcia Villa First, a poern must be magical, Then musical as a sea-gull. It must be a brightness moving And hold secret a bird's flowering.It must be slender as a bell, And it must hold fire as well. It must have the wisdom of bows And it must kneel like a rose. It must be able to hear The luminance of dove and deer. It must be able to hide What it seeks, like a bride. And over all I would like to hover God, smiling from the poem's cover.

                            30. ACTIVITY 1: Read the Lyrics of the song below.The Man Who Can't Be MoveGoing back to the corner where I first saw youGonna camp in my sleeping bag I'm not gonna moveGot some words on cardboard, got your picture in my handSaying, "If you see this girl can you tell her where I am?"Some try to hand me money, they don't understandI'm not broke - I'm just a broken-hearted manI know it makes no sense but what else can I do?How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing meAnd your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could beThinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meetAnd you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the streetSo I'm not moving, I'm not movingPoliceman says, "Son, you can't stay here."I said, "There's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year.Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows.If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go."'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing meAnd your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could beThinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meetAnd you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the streetSo I'm not moving, I'm not moving,I'm not moving, I'm not movingPeople talk about the guy that's waiting on a girl, oh ohhThere are no holes in his shoes but a big hole in his world, hmmAnd maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be movedMaybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the newsAnd you'll come running to the corner'Cause you'll know it's just for youI'm the man who can't be movedI'm the man who can't be movedGuide Questions:1.Where did the action happen?2.When did the action happen?3.Who is the persona?4.What are the actions done by the persona?5What is the reason behind his actions?​</h2><br />
