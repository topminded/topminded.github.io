                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Soil is the earth’s fragile skin that anchors all life on Earth. It is comprised of countless species that create a dynamic and complex ecosystem and is among the most precious resources to humans. Increased demand for agriculture commodities generates incentives to convert forests and grasslands to farm fields and pastures. The transition to agriculture from natural vegetation often cannot hold onto the soil and many of these plants, such as coffee, cotton, palm oil, soybean and wheat, can actually increase soil erosion beyond the soil’s ability to maintain itself.</p><p></p><p>Half of the topsoil on the planet has been lost in the last 150 years. In addition to erosion, soil quality is affected by other aspects of agriculture. These impacts include compaction, loss of soil structure, nutrient degradation, and soil salinity. These are very real and at times severe issues.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The effects of soil erosion go beyond the loss of fertile land. It has led to increased pollution and sedimentation in streams and rivers, clogging these waterways and causing declines in fish and other species. And degraded lands are also often less able to hold onto water, which can worsen flooding. Sustainable land use can help to reduce the impacts of agriculture and livestock, preventing soil degradation and erosion and the loss of valuable land to desertification.</p><p></p><p>The health of soil is a primary concern to farmers and the global community whose livelihoods depend on well managed agriculture that starts with the dirt beneath our feet. While there are many challenges to maintaining healthy soil, there are also solutions and a dedicated group of people, including WWF, who work to innovate and maintain the fragile skin from which biodiversity springs.</p><br />

Meanwhile, walke cotton and charcoal filter by crushing the charcoal and putting it in the cotton as tree This will remove impurities and still some bad taste from the boiled water. Fialy filter the boiled water through the cotton trap. 2. People looking to lose weight have a few options: exercise, diet, weight loss pills, and surgery. Exercising involves going to a gyro, working out at home or joining some sort of class or sports team. Those who are dieting can talk to a doctor about a plan for them. Weight loss pills can be taken, if proper precautions and directions are followed. Individuals who are severely overweight can talk to a doctor about having surgery to lose the weight that they need. 3. Energy and nutrients are transferred from organism through their feedins relationship. Producers are green plants, algae or microorganism that are capable of making their own food by converting the energy from the sun into a chemical energy Producers provide energy and nutrients to the organism. Consumer get their energy by feeding on plants and other organisms. Therefore, an animals are consumers Organism that eat only plants are herbivores. Living things that eat other animals are called carnivores. Some animals which eat pants and animals are omnivores. 4. Mixing Bleach Solution First, carefully pour the bleach into the spray bottle or jar first, then add the water. Mixing the solution in this order will prevent the bleach from splashing up on you.

How can a gas can be change into a plasma? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The kinetic energies of the particles (atoms, molecules, or ions) that make up a substance.</p><p>2. Heating a liquid increases the speed of the molecules. </p><p>3. The amount of energy in molecules of matter determines the state of matter. </p><p>4. chemical substance cannot be separated into its constituent elements by physical separation methods, i.e., without breaking chemical bonds.</p><p> 5.Chemical change</p><p>6.Decomposition in animals is a process that begins immediately after death and involves the destruction of soft tissue, leaving behind skeletonized remains. The chemical process of decomposition is complex and involves the breakdown of soft tissue, as the body passes through the sequential stages of decomposition.</p><p>7.Te ice will melt and the will gets hard when boiled</p><p>8.Gases can become plasmas in several ways, but all include pumping the gas with energy. A spark in a gas will create a plasma. A hot gas passing through a big spark will turn the gas stream into a plasma that can be useful.</p><p></p>#CARRYONLEARNING<br />
