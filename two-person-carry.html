                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The one-person carry is an effective technique for emergency situations where one person needs to be moved quickly and efficiently. There are several different methods for the one-person carry, including the shoulder pull, cradle lift, firefighter carry, and pack strap carry. The shoulder pull involves grabbing the person by their shoulders and pulling them towards you, while the cradle lift involves lifting them up in a cradle-like position. The firefighter carry involves lifting the person over your shoulder, and the pack strap carry involves using a strap to secure the person to your back. This technique is effective during emergencies because it allows for one person to quickly move another person without requiring additional assistance.</p><br />
