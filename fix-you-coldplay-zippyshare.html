Chris wrote the song "Fix You" for Gwyneth in order to comfort her after her father, Bruce Paltrow, died in 2002.The lyrics in the song are about how Gwyneth felt after her dad died.“Fix You” speaks about consoling someone you love.The song clearly speaks about a loss or letting go, which we can relate to at some point of our lives.<p></p><p>Whatbis the message of the song?</p>This song deals with true love, helping someone in your time of need, and learning from your mistakesThe singer acknowledges that people make mistakes in life, but these are instances that can also serve as valuable lessons. And judging by the metaphorical language used during the first part of the chorus, it can also be deemed that he feels fate – for lack of a better word – favors the healing of old emotional wounds. And along those same lines, he is also stating his dedication to “try to fix” the addressee. In other words he has also pledged to do what he can to help him or her get through a troubling period in their life.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><p>#MarkMeBrainliest</p><br />
