On Small-Scale Farming
by Jhonathan S. Cadavido
Carabaos and cows are important farm animals. [1] (Together with/Similar) other animals, they both help farmers in producing milk and other farm and dairy products. Meat, [2] (namely/for example), is one of the most important products that both of them can provide. [3] (Besides/Moreover), milk is also an essential item that carabaos and cows produce. [4] (In fact/Indeed), kesong puti is good for breakfast as spread or stuffing for varieties of bread [5] (that is/such as) pandesal and loaf bread. [6] (Therefore/Indeed), cows and carabaos can produce food items that we need in our daily lives.
Last year, we had to sell dozens of carabaos and cows for my parents to financially support me with my studies. [7] (As a result/Accordingly), my family recorded and generated small return of investment for that year. [8] (Instead/Although) we suffered a great loss, we still managed to survive with the help of my uncle.
Uncle Romeo has lent us his resources. [9] (On the other hand/Together with) this, he looked for possible investors who would finance our small farm business. [10] (Consequently/Meanwhile), a known dairy company, invested large amount of money to our small-scale farm. We accepted its offer. [11] (In fact/Wherefore), we have already started the expansion of our farm. From 20 remaining cows and carabaos, we now have at least hundreds of them. Our humble farm can now provide a large amount of milk products to our partner-company. [12] (For instance/Henceforth), we can at least supply them 500 liters of milk per day [13] (importantly/notwithstanding) the El Niño phenomenon that we are currently experiencing.
[14] (As a result/Similar) of this success, our family is planning to further expand our business venture, [15] (for example/to demonstrate), production of other farm products from hogs and chicken. [16] (Coupled with/Whereas) our dedication and enthusiasm, our partner-company has pledged to continuously support us in this endeavor. [17] (Comparatively/In fact), we are now working on our feasibility study about this concept. [18] (Consequently/Furthermore), other government policies and bank loans are considered for this project.
[19] (In conclusion/Otherwise), starting a business is not really an easy task, [20] (even more/indeed) a difficult one. [21] (Instead/While) others may not believe in your capacity, it is your duty to trust yourself and the process. With faith and confidence, you will surely achieve your dreams. From carabaos and cows, our small farm will soon be one of the famous haciendas in town producing and delivering quality products and goods.</a>

present and formal officials (known as cadres), and collected documentary evidence from local newspapers, journals and other sources. Greenhalgh notes that "Because I was largely constrained from asking direct
questions about resistance, the informal record of field notes, interview transcripts, and questionnaire data contains few overt challenges to state policy." Greenhalgh concludes, however, that their conversations with
the researchers, both peasants and cadres made strategic use of silence to protest aspects of the policy they did not like. Cadres, for example were loathe to comment on birth-planning campaigns; peasant women were reluctant to talk about sterilization. These silences form one part of the unofficial record of birth planning in the villages. More explicit protests were registered in informal conversations. From these interactions
emerged a sense of profound distress of villagers forced to choose between a resistance that was politically risky and a compliance that violated the norms of Chinese culture and of practical reason.

Uncle Romeo has lent us his resources. [9] (On the other hand/Together with) this, he looked for possible investors who would finance our small farm business. [10 (Consequently/Meanwhile), a known dairy company, invested large amount of money to our small-scale farm. We accepted its offer. [1] (In fact/Wherefore), we have already started the expansion of our farm. From 20 remaining cows and carabaos, we now have at least hundreds of them.

[12] (For instance/Henceforth), we can at least supply them 500 liters of milk per day 113) (importantly/notwithstanding) the El Niño phenomenon that we are currently experiencing. [14) (As a result/Similar) of this success, our family is planning to further expand our business venture, [15) (for example/to demonstrate), production of other farm products from hogs and chicken. [16] (Coupled with/Whereas) our dedication and enthusiasm, our partner-company has pledged to continuously support us in this endeavor, 117) (Comparatively/In fact), we are now working on our feasibility study about this concept. 18 (Consequently/Furthermore), other government policies and bank loans are considered for this project. (In conclusion/Otherwise), starting a business is not really an easy task, (20 (even more/indeed) a difficult one. 2 (Instead/While) others may not believe in your capacity, it is your duty to trust yourself and the process. With faith and confidence, you will surely achieve your dreams. From carabaos and cows, our small farm will soon be one of the famous haciendas in town producing and delivering quality products and goods. ​</a>

Simultaneously, most parents and carers can recall the days whencellphones didn't exist, and kids were really left all alone for in any event half of the day. I acceptcellphones today represent an incredible interruption for students — particularly better quality phonesthat give various chances to diversion — and therefore ought to be restricted from use in schools; andyet, I represent not forbidding cellphones from student’s ownership completely, since they permitguardians to screen their kids' wellbeing.The above all else motivation behind why cellphones ought to be restricted from use in schools is thatthey represent a huge interruption in the instructive procedure. The most evident sign of suchdisturbance is cheating during tests or different tests: access to the Internet, electronic books, andtalking with peers through any messaging or correspondence application directly from the study hall.Telephone rings, approaching message signals, as well as games, meddle with the instructiveprocedure by diverting educators and students from classes. Regardless of whether the sound is onsilent, a telephone's vibration despite everything diverts students.Another reason behind banning cellphones in classes is an expanded allurement for understudies tospeak with companions as opposed to concentrating on study material. By and by, the degree ofinnovation permits sharp cell phone proprietors to consistently check their informal organisationprofiles and peruse Internet content. Messaging itself, while being a very well known method forversatile correspondence among youth, turns out to be much all the more enticing when anunderstudy is tuning in to talk however has their brain meandering.One of the abnormal occurrences of utilising cellphones in schools is cyberbullying. Cellphonecameras are being utilised increasingly more frequently to record and spread unseemly pictures, forexample, photos of understudies in bathrooms; pictures of the inner parts of understudies' storagespaces; recordings of genuine and organised battles between understudies, just as the chronicles ofthe mortification of disagreeable understudies, etc. What's more, there were situations when modestpaid ahead of time 'disposable' telephones were utilised by understudies for bomb dangers.In spite of the fact that cellphones are important for high school students regarding their security, theyshould at present be restricted from use during classes. This idea is established on a few reasons, forexample, upsetting the instructive procedure and encouraging students cheating; divertingunderstudies by the likelihood to get to the Internet, web-based life, or speak with companions;likewise, cellphones add to the spreading of the social marvel known as cyberbullying.​</a>

On Small-Scale Farming
by Jhonathan S. Cadavido
Carabaos and cows are important farm animals. [1] (Together with/Similar) other animals, they both help farmers in producing milk and other farm and dairy products. Meat, [2] (namely/for example), is one of the most important products that both of them can provide. [3] (Besides/Moreover), milk is also an essential item that carabaos and cows produce. [4] (In fact/Indeed), kesong puti is good for breakfast as spread or stuffing for varieties of bread [5] (that is/such as) pandesal and loaf bread. [6] (Therefore/Indeed), cows and carabaos can produce food items that we need in our daily lives.
Last year, we had to sell dozens of carabaos and cows for my parents to financially support me with my studies. [7] (As a result/Accordingly), my family recorded and generated small return of investment for that year. [8] (Instead/Although) we suffered a great loss, we still managed to survive with the help of my uncle.
Uncle Romeo has lent us his resources. [9] (On the other hand/Together with) this, he looked for possible investors who would finance our small farm business. [10] (Consequently/Meanwhile), a known dairy company, invested large amount of money to our small-scale farm. We accepted its offer. [11] (In fact/Wherefore), we have already started the expansion of our farm. From 20 remaining cows and carabaos, we now have at least hundreds of them. Our humble farm can now provide a large amount of milk products to our partner-company. [12] (For instance/Henceforth), we can at least supply them 500 liters of milk per day [13] (importantly/notwithstanding) the El Niño phenomenon that we are currently experiencing.
[14] (As a result/Similar) of this success, our family is planning to further expand our business venture, [15] (for example/to demonstrate), production of other farm products from hogs and chicken. [16] (Coupled with/Whereas) our dedication and enthusiasm, our partner-company has pledged to continuously support us in this endeavor. [17] (Comparatively/In fact), we are now working on our feasibility study about this concept. [18] (Consequently/Furthermore), other government policies and bank loans are considered for this project.
[19] (In conclusion/Otherwise), starting a business is not really an easy task, [20] (even more/indeed) a difficult one. [21] (Instead/While) others may not believe in your capacity, it is your duty to trust yourself and the process. With faith and confidence, you will surely achieve your dreams. From carabaos and cows, our small farm will soon be one of the famous haciendas in town producing and delivering quality products and goods.</h2><br />

Identify the technique used to discover the themes in the data below.
In a study of birth planning in China, Greenhalgh (in Ryan and Bernard, 2003) surveyed 1,011 ever-married women, gathered social and economic histories from 150 families. She conducted in-depth interviews with
present and formal officials (known as cadres), and collected documentary evidence from local newspapers, journals and other sources. Greenhalgh notes that "Because I was largely constrained from asking direct
questions about resistance, the informal record of field notes, interview transcripts, and questionnaire data contains few overt challenges to state policy." Greenhalgh concludes, however, that their conversations with
the researchers, both peasants and cadres made strategic use of silence to protest aspects of the policy they did not like. Cadres, for example were loathe to comment on birth-planning campaigns; peasant women were reluctant to talk about sterilization. These silences form one part of the unofficial record of birth planning in the villages. More explicit protests were registered in informal conversations. From these interactions
emerged a sense of profound distress of villagers forced to choose between a resistance that was politically risky and a compliance that violated the norms of Chinese culture and of practical reason.

                            29. P-A-H-E-L-PIs the evidence provided strong or weak?Is the evidence enough to support the claim a reason?Why Cell Phones Should Not Be Allowed In SchoolsToday, practically any parent can utilise a cellphone to get some information about their whereabouts,occupation, or wellbeing. Simultaneously, most parents and carers can recall the days whencellphones didn't exist, and kids were really left all alone for in any event half of the day. I acceptcellphones today represent an incredible interruption for students — particularly better quality phonesthat give various chances to diversion — and therefore ought to be restricted from use in schools; andyet, I represent not forbidding cellphones from student’s ownership completely, since they permitguardians to screen their kids' wellbeing.The above all else motivation behind why cellphones ought to be restricted from use in schools is thatthey represent a huge interruption in the instructive procedure. The most evident sign of suchdisturbance is cheating during tests or different tests: access to the Internet, electronic books, andtalking with peers through any messaging or correspondence application directly from the study hall.Telephone rings, approaching message signals, as well as games, meddle with the instructiveprocedure by diverting educators and students from classes. Regardless of whether the sound is onsilent, a telephone's vibration despite everything diverts students.Another reason behind banning cellphones in classes is an expanded allurement for understudies tospeak with companions as opposed to concentrating on study material. By and by, the degree ofinnovation permits sharp cell phone proprietors to consistently check their informal organisationprofiles and peruse Internet content. Messaging itself, while being a very well known method forversatile correspondence among youth, turns out to be much all the more enticing when anunderstudy is tuning in to talk however has their brain meandering.One of the abnormal occurrences of utilising cellphones in schools is cyberbullying. Cellphonecameras are being utilised increasingly more frequently to record and spread unseemly pictures, forexample, photos of understudies in bathrooms; pictures of the inner parts of understudies' storagespaces; recordings of genuine and organised battles between understudies, just as the chronicles ofthe mortification of disagreeable understudies, etc. What's more, there were situations when modestpaid ahead of time 'disposable' telephones were utilised by understudies for bomb dangers.In spite of the fact that cellphones are important for high school students regarding their security, theyshould at present be restricted from use during classes. This idea is established on a few reasons, forexample, upsetting the instructive procedure and encouraging students cheating; divertingunderstudies by the likelihood to get to the Internet, web-based life, or speak with companions;likewise, cellphones add to the spreading of the social marvel known as cyberbullying.​</h2><br />
