The sample was vacuum sealed on the Moon and stored in a second protective vacuum tube since it was collected by the Apollo 17 crew in December 1972. The sample was kept sealed through the decades so that scientists "in the future" could analyze it using more improved scientific and technologic methods. Apollo was NASA's last manned mission to the Moon while the next mission will be called Artemis. "We have an opportunity to address some really important questions about the Moon by learning from what has been recorded and preserved in the regolith of these Apollo samples," said NASA Astromaterials Curator Francis McCubbin, "We curated these samples for the long term, so that scientists 50 years in the future could analyze them. Through Artemis, we hope to offer the same possibilities for a new generation of scientists." 6. Who published the news article? 7. When was it published? 8. What organization was cited as the source of information? 9. How long was the sample kept by scientists? 10. Why did the scientists store the Apollo-era sample through the decades?​</a>

The sample was vacuum sealed on the Moon and stored in a second protective vacuum tube since it was collected by the Apollo 17 crew in December 1972. The sample was kept sealed through the decades so that scientists "in the future" could analyze it using more improved scientific and technologic methods. Apollo was NASA's last manned mission to the Moon while the next mission will be called Artemis. "We have an opportunity to address some really important questions about the Moon by learning from what has been recorded and preserved in the regolith of these Apollo samples," said NASA Astromaterials Curator Francis McCubbin, "We curated these samples for the long term, so that scientists 50 years in the future could analyze them. Through Artemis, we hope to offer the same possibilities for a new generation of scientists." 6. Who published the news article? 7. When was it published? 8.
