                                            Education is a process that involves the transfer of knowledge, habits and skills from one generation to another through teaching, research and training. It can be in a formal or informal setting. Formal education involves institutionalized learning based on a curriculum. In today’s society, education and learning play an indispensable role in shaping the lives of individuals and the society at large.

A highly educated labor force further stimulates economic growth. Additionally, a highly educated labor force can easily adapt to new working environments and conditions. In view of that, it is evident that education serves as the driving force for innovation of new products and services. Educated workers exchange ideas in the work place and come up with new ideas that help in the growth of the economy. Education reduces poverty in a number of ways. One way is by creating employment opportunities for educated people. Through employment, one is able to afford a decent living Education helps to increase economic security, create income opportunities and improve livelihoods of the economically disadvantaged by providing sustainable environmental management mechanisms.

                                            Case on Education and Training    The President/COO of a small manufacturing firm of about 300 employees had learned over the years the value of education and training. Every company was investing in education and training. It was understood by everyone in top management that to remain competitive they would have to change. Change would mean that some rather dramatic changes would have to occur in the way the company had been managed and the skills that current employees possessed.    This company had been providing company and supplier sponsored seminars and training sessions for years. Management representatives commonly attended trade shows and attended popular workshops on quality, marketing, sales, technology and certification.    A local university was contacted and asked to deliver a series of on-site courses, to about thirty workers at a time. All training costs would be provided by the company for anyone who wanted to enroll.Question:1. Do you think this company has a culture of TQM? Why or Why not?​</a>

This research determined the perception toward online education among faculty in a State College in the Philippines. This study used a descriptive online survey involving a sample of 27 faculty members. Statistical tools employed were descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test. Research findings indicated that the majority of faculty had intermediate computer competency and had no training in online teaching with only a few having a very stable internet connection. Faculty considered that online education will result to more academic dishonesty, will be impersonal and lack feeling compared to face-to-face classes, and will be difficult to manage in terms of technology. Additionally, faculty were undecided if they are in favor of online education. The faculty significantly differed whether they are in favor of online education based on age, sex, college, educational attainment, years in teaching, academic rank, level taught and employment status. Faculty of Higher Education Institutions must be provided with continued support and training as they adapt into the new normal in the higher education landscape and as they embrace the instructional challenges brought by the Coronavirus disease 19 pandemic.</a>

Importance of Education Education is a process that involves the transfer of knowledge, habits and skills from one generation to another through teaching, research and training. It can be in a formal or informal setting. Formal education involves institutionalized learning based on a curriculum. In today’s society, education and learning play an indispensable role in shaping the lives of individuals and the society at large. The most effective way of boosting economic growth, reducing poverty and improving people’s health is by investing ineducation. Human labor is essential for economic growth. A highly educated labor force further stimulates economic growth. Additionally, a highly educated labor force can easily adapt to new working environments and conditions. In view of that, it is evident that education serves as the driving force for innovation of new products and services. Educated workers exchange ideas in the workplace and come up with new ideas that help in the growth of the economy. Education reduces poverty in a number of ways. One way is by creating employment opportunities for educated people. Through employment, one is able to afford a decent living. Education helps to increase economic security, create income opportunities and improve livelihoods of the economically disadvantaged by providing sustainable environmental management mechanisms. Education further alleviates poverty through skills acquired in the learning process. Skills such as carpentry, plumbing and masonry are relevant in non-formal economies. One can acquire these skills through technical and vocational training. Educated people are health conscious and live longer than their counterparts because they engage in healthy habits such as eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly and going for medical checkups. By investing in education, one will also be investing in their health. Education serves to create room for technological advancements in the field of medicine and agriculture. Advanced technology used for conducting surgery has replaced traditional methods. This has seen an improvement in people’s general health and an increased life expectancy. Most developing countries have a low life expectancy compared to developed countries. This can be attributed to high illiteracy levels present in developing countries. This translates to poor health and poor eating habits. In conclusion, education is the only means of alleviating poverty, improving people’s health and increasing economic growth. Improving literacy levels in marginalized societies will go a long way in improving human living standards and sustainable environmental management mechanisms.

                                            Essay 1: Importance of Education Education is a process that involves the transfer of knowledge, habits and skills from one generation to another through teaching, research and training it can be in a formal or informal setting. Formal education involves institutionalized learning based on a curriculum In today's society, education and learning play an indispensable role in shaping the lives of individuals and the society at large. The most effective way of boosting economic growth, reducing poverty and improving people's health is by investing in education. Human labor is essential for economic growth. A highly educated labor force further stimulates economic growth. Additionally, a highly educated labor force can easily adapt to new working environments and conditions. In view of that, it is evident that education serves as the driving force for innovation of new products and services. Educated workers exchange ideas in the work place and come up with new ideas that help in the growth of the economy. Education reduces poverty in a number of ways. One way is by creating employment opportunities for educated people. Through employment, one is able to afford a decent living. Education helps to increase economic security, create income opportunities and improve livelihoods of the economically disadvantaged by providing sustainable environmental management mechanisms. Education further alleviates poverty through skills acquired in the learning process. Skills such as carpentry, plumbing and masonry are relevant in non-formal economies. One can acquire these skills through technical and vocational training Educated people are health conscious and live longer than their counterparts because they engage in healthy habits such as eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly and going for medical check-ups. By investing in education, one will also be investing in their health. Education serves to create room for technological advancements in the field of medicine and agriculture. Advanced technology used for conducting surgery has replaced traditional methods. This has seen an improvement in people's general health and an increased life expectancy. Most developing countries have a low life expectancy compared to developed countries. This can be attributed to high illiteracy levels present in developing countries. This translates to poor health and poor eating habits. In conclusion, education is the only means of alleviating poverty, improving people's health and increasing economic growth. Improving literacy levels in marginalized societies will go a long way in improving human living standards   SUMMARIZES​</a>

                            9. Case on Education and Training    The President/COO of a small manufacturing firm of about 300 employees had learned over the years the value of education and training. Every company was investing in education and training. It was understood by everyone in top management that to remain competitive they would have to change. Change would mean that some rather dramatic changes would have to occur in the way the company had been managed and the skills that current employees possessed.    This company had been providing company and supplier sponsored seminars and training sessions for years. Management representatives commonly attended trade shows and attended popular workshops on quality, marketing, sales, technology and certification.    A local university was contacted and asked to deliver a series of on-site courses, to about thirty workers at a time. All training costs would be provided by the company for anyone who wanted to enroll.Question:1. Do you think this company has a culture of TQM? Why or Why not?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>As a whole…., It's not easy to introduce TQM. An open, cooperative culture has to be created by management. Employees have to be made to feel that they are responsible for customer satisfaction. They are not going to feel this if they are excluded from the development of visions, strategies, and plans. It's important they participate in these activities. They are unlikely to behave in a responsible way if they see management behaving irresponsibly - saying one thing and doing the opposite.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>HOPE IT'S HELP PA BRAINLIEST TY</p><p>SOURCE; G0OGLE</p><p></p><p></p><br />

This research determined the perception toward online education among faculty in a State College in the Philippines. This study used a descriptive online survey involving a sample of 27 faculty members. Statistical tools employed were descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test. Research findings indicated that the majority of faculty had intermediate computer competency and had no training in online teaching with only a few having a very stable internet connection. Faculty considered that online education will result to more academic dishonesty, will be impersonal and lack feeling compared to face-to-face classes, and will be difficult to manage in terms of technology. Additionally, faculty were undecided if they are in favor of online education. The faculty significantly differed whether they are in favor of online education based on age, sex, college, educational attainment, years in teaching, academic rank, level taught and employment status. Faculty of Higher Education Institutions must be provided with continued support and training as they adapt into the new normal in the higher education landscape and as they embrace the instructional challenges brought by the Coronavirus disease 19 pandemic.</h2><br />

                            24. Write a summary of the article below using writing summary techniques learned.           Importance of Education Education is a process that involves the transfer of knowledge, habits and skills from one generation to another through teaching, research and training. It can be in a formal or informal setting. Formal education involves institutionalized learning based on a curriculum. In today’s society, education and learning play an indispensable role in shaping the lives of individuals and the society at large. The most effective way of boosting economic growth, reducing poverty and improving people’s health is by investing ineducation. Human labor is essential for economic growth. A highly educated labor force further stimulates economic growth. Additionally, a highly educated labor force can easily adapt to new working environments and conditions. In view of that, it is evident that education serves as the driving force for innovation of new products and services. Educated workers exchange ideas in the workplace and come up with new ideas that help in the growth of the economy. Education reduces poverty in a number of ways. One way is by creating employment opportunities for educated people. Through employment, one is able to afford a decent living. Education helps to increase economic security, create income opportunities and improve livelihoods of the economically disadvantaged by providing sustainable environmental management mechanisms. Education further alleviates poverty through skills acquired in the learning process. Skills such as carpentry, plumbing and masonry are relevant in non-formal economies. One can acquire these skills through technical and vocational training. Educated people are health conscious and live longer than their counterparts because they engage in healthy habits such as eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly and going for medical checkups. By investing in education, one will also be investing in their health. Education serves to create room for technological advancements in the field of medicine and agriculture. Advanced technology used for conducting surgery has replaced traditional methods. This has seen an improvement in people’s general health and an increased life expectancy. Most developing countries have a low life expectancy compared to developed countries. This can be attributed to high illiteracy levels present in developing countries. This translates to poor health and poor eating habits. In conclusion, education is the only means of alleviating poverty, improving people’s health and increasing economic growth. Improving literacy levels in marginalized societies will go a long way in improving human living standards and sustainable environmental management mechanisms.

                            30. Essay 1: Importance of Education Education is a process that involves the transfer of knowledge, habits and skills from one generation to another through teaching, research and training it can be in a formal or informal setting. Formal education involves institutionalized learning based on a curriculum In today's society, education and learning play an indispensable role in shaping the lives of individuals and the society at large. The most effective way of boosting economic growth, reducing poverty and improving people's health is by investing in education. Human labor is essential for economic growth. A highly educated labor force further stimulates economic growth. Additionally, a highly educated labor force can easily adapt to new working environments and conditions. In view of that, it is evident that education serves as the driving force for innovation of new products and services. Educated workers exchange ideas in the work place and come up with new ideas that help in the growth of the economy. Education reduces poverty in a number of ways. One way is by creating employment opportunities for educated people. Through employment, one is able to afford a decent living. Education helps to increase economic security, create income opportunities and improve livelihoods of the economically disadvantaged by providing sustainable environmental management mechanisms. Education further alleviates poverty through skills acquired in the learning process. Skills such as carpentry, plumbing and masonry are relevant in non-formal economies. One can acquire these skills through technical and vocational training Educated people are health conscious and live longer than their counterparts because they engage in healthy habits such as eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly and going for medical check-ups. By investing in education, one will also be investing in their health. Education serves to create room for technological advancements in the field of medicine and agriculture. Advanced technology used for conducting surgery has replaced traditional methods. This has seen an improvement in people's general health and an increased life expectancy. Most developing countries have a low life expectancy compared to developed countries. This can be attributed to high illiteracy levels present in developing countries. This translates to poor health and poor eating habits. In conclusion, education is the only means of alleviating poverty, improving people's health and increasing economic growth. Improving literacy levels in marginalized societies will go a long way in improving human living standards   SUMMARIZES​</h2><br />
