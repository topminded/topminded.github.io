                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Here are the must-know legal requirements for your event planning business</p><p>If you own your own business you might have some of these covered already. But it’s good to review just in case there are some new (or even surprising) legal issues you hadn’t considered before. </p><p></p><p>1. Pay business taxes</p><p>If you don’t have your own tax advisor, you need to start by reviewing common tax pitfalls, which include things like deductions specifics and proper documentation. </p><p></p><p>Problem: It’s your first year as an event planner and because you haven’t had a ton of clients you forego paying quarterly taxes. At the end of the year, your tax preparer tells you that the business was responsible for quarterly IRS payments. </p><p></p><p>Solution: Speaking with a licensed tax professional to make sure your business is properly set up with the government. And make sure to set aside the proper amount of taxes you’ll owe from each and every job. </p><p></p><p>2. Get a business license</p><p>Some cities will fine or suspend your business activities for not having the right paperwork in order when you’re first starting out. </p><p></p><p>Problem: You get a mysterious letter in the mail from your city’s small business office claiming you owe them a large lump sum after neglecting to apply for the proper license. </p><p></p><p>Solution: Pay the fine immediately and get your business registered. Your local office should be able to walk you through the process online or over the phone. A little payment up front now can save you big surprise fees in the future.3. Create the right client contracts</p><p>Every event planning contract you write for a client should include certain clauses that cover all your bases in case things go wrong for either party. </p><p></p><p>Problem: You’re approached by a longtime friend about a large event they’d love for you plan. Because you have a pre existing relationship or have done business with them before, you figure you might as well avoid the discomfort of asking them to sign anything. Then, in the midst of planning the event, something beyond your control goes wrong and they no longer want to pay you for your time. </p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><br />
