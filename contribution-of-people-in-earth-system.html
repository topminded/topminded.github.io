We collected orange, white, and brown shells of all different shapes and sizes. When our bucket was almost filled, I spotted something black and shiny pointing out of the sand. I reached down and grabbed the object right before a wave crashed against my legs. The object felt sharp and curvy. Finally, I opened my hand. “What is this?” I asked my dad.

His ears are turned back while his noble looking head is held high. His all black coat glistens in the late afternoon sun. His face displays a strong confidence with his nostrils flared, his veins bulging from his cheek bones, and his fiery black eyes burning holes into the souls of those who stare into them. His neck muscles are tensed and thickened with adrenalin. His black main is thrown into the wind like a flag rippling in the winds of a tornado. His muscular front legs are brought up to his chest displaying his flashing gray hooves that could crush a man's scull with one blow. His backbone and underbelly are held almost straight up and his hind quarters are tensed. His back legs are spread apart for balance. His back hooves are pressed into the earth; therefore, his hooves cause deep gouges from the weight of his body on the soil. His black tail is held straight down and every once in a while a burst of wind catches it and then it floats down back into place like an elegant piece of silk falling from the sky. His bravery and strength are what made his breed prized as a warhorse. a.Narrativeb.Descriptivec.Literaryd.Expositorye.Persuasive3. In Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, Boo Radley's reputation comes not from anything he has done, but rather from the lack of information that the community has about him. Boo Radley is virtually unknown in the community. After getting into trouble with the police, Boo “was not seen again for 15 years” (p. 9). Mr Radley ensures that Boo remains hidden and as a result, he is completely mysterious to people in Maycomb. Because of the mystery surrounding his character, the community begins to blame Boo for unexplained events. Boo gets held responsible for things he's not involved in including “any stealthy crime committed in Maycomb” (p.9). It seems that the town of Maycomb, when looking for someone to Blame, look to Boo because they know so little about him. As time goes own and the mystery increases, the children in the town start to create myths around Boo Radley. Jem claims to Dill that he “dine[s] on raw squirrels” (p.14). The children have heard the stories and so their imaginations run wild and begin to turn Boo into a kind of mythical creature. Everything about him is exaggerated. Boo Radley may well be unusual, but most of the things that people in the town of Maycomb say about are not based in fact, they are simply stories that have developed because he is unknown. a.Narrativeb.Descriptivec.Literaryd.Expositorye.Persuasive4. People often think all planets are alike, but there are actually three types of planets in the solar system. The terrestrial planets are made of rock and metal and are closest to the sun. These include the midsize planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. They rotate slowly and don’t have many moons. Farther from the sun are the planets called gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They are called gas giants because they are formed from gases such as hydrogen and helium. Gas giants rotate fast and have many moons. Finally, planetoids are objects made up of rock and ice and are too small to be true “planets.” Planetoids sometimes even get pulled into a planet’s gravitational field and become moons themselves. Whether they are terrestrials, gas giants, or planetoids, the planets in the solar system are fascinating. a.Narrativeb.Descriptivec.Literaryd.Expositorye.Persuasive5. Immigration contributes to the overall health of the American economy. Despite recent concerns expressed about illegal and some legal immigration to the United States, this country has largely benefited from the skills, talents, and ambition that immigrants bring with them. American businesses gain from a good source of affordable labor, while towns and cities are revitalized by immigrant families who strengthen communities through civic participation and the generation of new economic activity. The United States must continue to welcome new arrivals and help those who are already here; otherwise, the country will lose the advantages it has over other industrialized countries that compete against us in the global marketplace and seek to recruit from a vast pool of unskilled and skilled global workers. a.Narrativeb.Descriptivec.Literaryd.Expositorye.Persuasive​​​</a>

                                            1.My first seashell hunt had a surprise ending. Early one morning my dad and I walked to the beach with a red bucket. The sand was soft and cool. We collected orange, white, and brown shells of all different shapes and sizes. When our bucket was almost filled, I spotted something black and shiny pointing out of the sand. I reached down and grabbed the object right before a wave crashed against my legs. The object felt sharp and curvy. Finally, I opened my hand. “What is this?” I asked my dad. He said, “It’s your lucky day. That’s a shark’s tooth!” NarrativeDescriptiveLiteraryExpositoryPersuasive2. Standing on his hind legs, this rare andalucian stallion is fearless. His ears are turned back while his noble looking head is held high. His all black coat glistens in the late afternoon sun. His face displays a strong confidence with his nostrils flared, his veins bulging from his cheek bones, and his fiery black eyes burning holes into the souls of those who stare into them. His neck muscles are tensed and thickened with adrenalin. His black main is thrown into the wind like a flag rippling in the winds of a tornado. His muscular front legs are brought up to his chest displaying his flashing gray hooves that could crush a man's scull with one blow. His backbone and underbelly are held almost straight up and his hind quarters are tensed. His back legs are spread apart for balance. His back hooves are pressed into the earth; therefore, his hooves cause deep gouges from the weight of his body on the soil. His black tail is held straight down and every once in a while a burst of wind catches it and then it floats down back into place like an elegant piece of silk falling from the sky. His bravery and strength are what made his breed prized as a warhorse. NarrativeDescriptiveLiteraryExpositoryPersuasive3. In Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, Boo Radley's reputation comes not from anything he has done, but rather from the lack of information that the community has about him. Boo Radley is virtually unknown in the community. After getting into trouble with the police, Boo “was not seen again for 15 years” (p. 9). Mr Radley ensures that Boo remains hidden and as a result, he is completely mysterious to people in Maycomb. Because of the mystery surrounding his character, the community begins to blame Boo for unexplained events. Boo gets held responsible for things he's not involved in including “any stealthy crime committed in Maycomb” (p.9). It seems that the town of Maycomb, when looking for someone to Blame, look to Boo because they know so little about him. As time goes own and the mystery increases, the children in the town start to create myths around Boo Radley. Jem claims to Dill that he “dine[s] on raw squirrels” (p.14). The children have heard the stories and so their imaginations run wild and begin to turn Boo into a kind of mythical creature. Everything about him is exaggerated. Boo Radley may well be unusual, but most of the things that people in the town of Maycomb say about are not based in fact, they are simply stories that have developed because he is unknown.

The terrestrial planets are made of rock and metal and are closest to the sun. These include the midsize planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. They rotate slowly and don’t have many moons. Farther from the sun are the planets called gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They are called gas giants because they are formed from gases such as hydrogen and helium. Gas giants rotate fast and have many moons. Finally, planetoids are objects made up of rock and ice and are too small to be true “planets.” Planetoids sometimes even get pulled into a planet’s gravitational field and become moons themselves. Whether they are terrestrials, gas giants, or planetoids, the planets in the solar system are fascinating. NarrativeDescriptiveLiteraryExpositoryPersuasive5. Immigration contributes to the overall health of the American economy. Despite recent concerns expressed about illegal and some legal immigration to the United States, this country has largely benefited from the skills, talents, and ambition that immigrants bring with them. American businesses gain from a good source of affordable labor, while towns and cities are revitalized by immigrant families who strengthen communities through civic participation and the generation of new economic activity. The United States must continue to welcome new arrivals and help those who are already here; otherwise, the country will lose the advantages it has over other industrialized countries that compete against us in the global marketplace and seek to recruit from a vast pool of unskilled and skilled global workers.

In the spring, toads lay their eggs in ponds, lakes and puddles. Then, tinytadpoles come out of the eggs. The tadpoles live in the water for several weeks.Next, the tadpoles start to develop back legs, and then front legs. Finally, thetadpoles lose their tails. They are ready to come out of the water--as tiny, tinytoads!2. Saturn is the second largest planet in the solar system, much larger thanEarth. It is mostly made of hydrogen. It rotates more quickly too. A day on Saturn isonly about 10 Earth hours long. But it takes about 30 of our years to make one fulltrip around the sun.3.A beech tree has very smooth bark. Unfortunately, this can cause aproblem for the tree. Sometimes people decide that they want to write their namesin the bark. When they do this, they can harm the tree. Diseases can attack the treethrough the cuts in the bark. Trees can die because of these diseases.4. Coral snakes are distinguished by their red, yellow/white, and blackcolored banding. Most species of are small in size. North American species averagearound 3 feet in length, but specimens of up to 5 feet or slightly larger have beenreported5. In most parts of the world, there are not as many crocodiles as there usedto be. This is the problem because crocodiles are becoming endangered and alsocrocodiles necessary to he balance of nature. Many crocodiles have died becausepeople dried up the swamps and marshes where the crocodiles live. Poachers havealso contributed to the dilemma as crocodiles have been desired for their strong,smooth, leathery skins. In order to preserve these mighty creatures, people musttake care of the crocodiles' environment and help put a stop to the needlessshooting of these animals.​</a>

                                            Learning Task 1Directions: Read each paragraph carefully. Identify what type of paragraph it is by writing Narrative, Descriptive, Expository, Persuasive or Literary. (10 points)___________ 1. My first seashell hunt had a surprise ending. Early one morning my dad and I walked to the beach with a red bucket. The sand was soft and cool.  We collected orange, white, and brown shells of all different shapes and sizes. When our bucket was almost filled, I spotted something black and shiny pointing out of the sand. I reached down and grabbed the object right before a wave crashed against my legs. The object felt sharp and curvy. Finally, I opened my hand. “What is this?” I asked my dad.  He said, “It’s your lucky day. That’s a shark’s tooth!”___________ 2. Standing on his hind legs, this rare andalucian stallion is fearless. His ears are turned back while his noble looking head is held high. His all black coat glistens in the late afternoon sun. His face displays a strong confidence with his nostrils flared, his veins bulging from his cheek bones, and his fiery black eyes burning holes into the souls of those who stare into them. His neck muscles are tensed and thickened with adrenalin. His black main is thrown into the wind like a flag rippling in the winds of a tornado. His muscular front legs are brought up to his chest displaying his flashing gray hooves that could crush a man's scull with one blow. His backbone and underbelly are held almost straight up and his hind quarters are tensed. His back legs are spread apart for balance. His back hooves are pressed into the earth; therefore, his hooves cause deep gouges from the weight of his body on the soil. His black tail is held straight down and every once in a while a burst of wind catches it and then it floats down back into place like an elegant piece of silk falling from the sky. His bravery and strength are what made his breed prized as a warhorse.___________ 3. In Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, Boo Radley's reputation comes not from anything he has done, but rather from the lack of information that the community has about him. Boo Radley is virtually unknown in the community. After getting into trouble with the police, Boo “was not seen again for 15 years” (p. 9). Mr Radley ensures that Boo remains hidden and as a result, he is completely mysterious to people in Maycomb. Because of the mystery surrounding his character, the community begins to blame Boo for unexplained events. Boo gets held responsible for things he's not involved in including “any stealthy crime committed in Maycomb” (p.9). It seems that the town of Maycomb, when looking for someone to Blame, look to Boo because they know so little about him. As time goes own and the mystery increases, the children in the town start to create myths around Boo Radley. Jem claims to Dill that he “dine[s] on raw squirrels” (p.14). The children have heard the stories and so their imaginations run wild and begin to turn Boo into a kind of mythical creature. Everything about him is exaggerated. Boo Radley may well be unusual, but most of the things that people in the town of Maycomb say about are not based in fact, they are simply stories that have developed because he is unknown.___________ 4. People often think all planets are alike, but there are actually three types of planets in the solar system. The terrestrial planets are made of rock and metal and are closest to the sun. These include the midsize planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. They rotate slowly and don’t have many moons. Farther from the sun are the planets called gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They are called gas giants because they are formed from gases such as hydrogen and helium. Gas giants rotate fast and have many moons. Finally, planetoids are objects made up of rock and ice and are too small to be true “planets.” Planetoids sometimes even get pulled into a planet’s gravitational field and become moons themselves. Whether they are terrestrials, gas giants, or planetoids, the planets in the solar system are fascinating.___________ 5. Immigration contributes to the overall health of the American economy. Despite recent concerns expressed about illegal and some legal immigration to the United States, this country has largely benefited from the skills, talents, and ambition that immigrants bring with them. American businesses gain from a good source of affordable labor, while towns and cities are revitalized by immigrant families who strengthen communities through civic participation and the generation of new economic activity. The United States must continue to welcome new arrivals and help those who are already here; otherwise, the country will lose the advantages it has over other industrialized countries that compete against us in the global marketplace and seek to recruit from a vast pool of unskilled and skilled global workers.​</a>

                            1. Contributions of personalities or people on understanding the earth systems</h2><br />
                        <p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Contributions of personalities or people</strong> like James Hutton, Alexander von Humboldt, Vladimir Vernadsky, James Lovelock, and Lynn Margulis have built the foundations<strong> on understanding the earth systems</strong>. Their deep knowledge about the other fields of sciences have made an impact to the way we comprehend our unique planet.
</p><p>James Hutton, who is considered the father of geology, has observed the shape of land by different forces through farming. He was the one who used the concept of uniformitarianism about the similarities of past and present geological forces like volcanic eruptions and erosion which determine the history of earth through rocks.
</p><p>Alexander von Humboldt, a geographer, who observed nature and recognized the patterns revealing basic processes, like the transfer of heat in ocean currents and the effect of temperature on plants and their growth.
</p><p>Vladimir Vernadsky, who is one of the founders of geochemistry, made a theory about the development of earth in three phases. First phase is geosphere, second is biosphere and third is noosphere. He popularized noosphere which is the sphere of human consciousness. 
</p><p>James Lovelock, an environmentalist, explained the earth as self-regulating system through Gaia hypothesis. As an example, he mentioned the photosynthetic bacteria that lived during Precambrian period. He added that the said bacteria altered the atmosphere of the earth making it oxygen-enriched.
</p><p>Lynn Margulis, an evolutionary theorist, has advanced the Gaia hypothesis of James Lovelock. She concluded that atmospheric gases came from biological sources like bacteria which give off gases. Margulis and Lovelock worked together in publishing a paper which explains how life normalizes the chemical composition and temperature of the atmosphere, as well as, the soil.
</p><p>At present, the scientists of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are the ones that keep on studying the earth systems and publishing their findings for the better understanding of everyone.

                        <p>       As a topic, the Earth System looks at the connection of everything on earth through its interaction. This study would not be possible if not for some very special people.
</p><p><strong>*Alexander von Humboldt</strong> from Berlin<strong> promoted the idea of considering  everything on earth as a whole, </strong>thus creating a template for the Earth System theory.
</p><p><strong>*Vladimir Vernadsky </strong>saw how the self sustaining function of the<strong> Biosphere</strong>  promotes the perpetual creation, diversification and ending of life. 
</p><p>*<strong>James Lovelock</strong> from England proposed and defended the looping effect that happens within the system. He is credited for the development of the <strong>Gaia Hypothesis </strong>that shows the efficiency of the internal interactions within the sphere.
</p><p><strong>*Lynn Margulis</strong> aided <strong>James Lovelock</strong> in the further advancement of the his Hypothesis.
</p><p><strong>*Michael Mann</strong> made it his goal to fully understand the climate area of the research through the ESSC facility in Pennsylvania in the United States.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>It is worth mentioning that much earlier societies and civilizations have always view the environment as a living thing, which may be considered the unofficial and unwritten beginning of the Earth System Hypothesis.

                            12. 1.My first seashell hunt had a surprise ending. Early one morning my dad and I walked to the beach with a red bucket. The sand was soft and cool. We collected orange, white, and brown shells of all different shapes and sizes. When our bucket was almost filled, I spotted something black and shiny pointing out of the sand. I reached down and grabbed the object right before a wave crashed against my legs. The object felt sharp and curvy. Finally, I opened my hand. “What is this?” I asked my dad. He said, “It’s your lucky day. That’s a shark’s tooth!” a.Narrativeb.Descriptivec.Literaryd.Expositorye.Persuasive2. Standing on his hind legs, this rare andalucian stallion is fearless. His ears are turned back while his noble looking head is held high. His all black coat glistens in the late afternoon sun. His face displays a strong confidence with his nostrils flared, his veins bulging from his cheek bones, and his fiery black eyes burning holes into the souls of those who stare into them. His neck muscles are tensed and thickened with adrenalin. His black main is thrown into the wind like a flag rippling in the winds of a tornado. His muscular front legs are brought up to his chest displaying his flashing gray hooves that could crush a man's scull with one blow. His backbone and underbelly are held almost straight up and his hind quarters are tensed. His back legs are spread apart for balance. His back hooves are pressed into the earth; therefore, his hooves cause deep gouges from the weight of his body on the soil. His black tail is held straight down and every once in a while a burst of wind catches it and then it floats down back into place like an elegant piece of silk falling from the sky. His bravery and strength are what made his breed prized as a warhorse. a.Narrativeb.Descriptivec.Literaryd.Expositorye.Persuasive3. In Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, Boo Radley's reputation comes not from anything he has done, but rather from the lack of information that the community has about him. Boo Radley is virtually unknown in the community. After getting into trouble with the police, Boo “was not seen again for 15 years” (p. 9). Mr Radley ensures that Boo remains hidden and as a result, he is completely mysterious to people in Maycomb. Because of the mystery surrounding his character, the community begins to blame Boo for unexplained events. Boo gets held responsible for things he's not involved in including “any stealthy crime committed in Maycomb” (p.9). It seems that the town of Maycomb, when looking for someone to Blame, look to Boo because they know so little about him. As time goes own and the mystery increases, the children in the town start to create myths around Boo Radley. Jem claims to Dill that he “dine[s] on raw squirrels” (p.14). The children have heard the stories and so their imaginations run wild and begin to turn Boo into a kind of mythical creature. Everything about him is exaggerated. Boo Radley may well be unusual, but most of the things that people in the town of Maycomb say about are not based in fact, they are simply stories that have developed because he is unknown. a.Narrativeb.Descriptivec.Literaryd.Expositorye.Persuasive4. People often think all planets are alike, but there are actually three types of planets in the solar system. The terrestrial planets are made of rock and metal and are closest to the sun. These include the midsize planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. They rotate slowly and don’t have many moons. Farther from the sun are the planets called gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They are called gas giants because they are formed from gases such as hydrogen and helium. Gas giants rotate fast and have many moons. Finally, planetoids are objects made up of rock and ice and are too small to be true “planets.” Planetoids sometimes even get pulled into a planet’s gravitational field and become moons themselves. Whether they are terrestrials, gas giants, or planetoids, the planets in the solar system are fascinating. a.Narrativeb.Descriptivec.Literaryd.Expositorye.Persuasive5. Immigration contributes to the overall health of the American economy. Despite recent concerns expressed about illegal and some legal immigration to the United States, this country has largely benefited from the skills, talents, and ambition that immigrants bring with them. American businesses gain from a good source of affordable labor, while towns and cities are revitalized by immigrant families who strengthen communities through civic participation and the generation of new economic activity. The United States must continue to welcome new arrivals and help those who are already here; otherwise, the country will lose the advantages it has over other industrialized countries that compete against us in the global marketplace and seek to recruit from a vast pool of unskilled and skilled global workers. a.Narrativeb.Descriptivec.Literaryd.Expositorye.Persuasive​​​</h2><br />

                            20. 1.My first seashell hunt had a surprise ending. Early one morning my dad and I walked to the beach with a red bucket. The sand was soft and cool. We collected orange, white, and brown shells of all different shapes and sizes. When our bucket was almost filled, I spotted something black and shiny pointing out of the sand. I reached down and grabbed the object right before a wave crashed against my legs. The object felt sharp and curvy. Finally, I opened my hand. “What is this?” I asked my dad. He said, “It’s your lucky day. That’s a shark’s tooth!” NarrativeDescriptiveLiteraryExpositoryPersuasive2. Standing on his hind legs, this rare andalucian stallion is fearless. His ears are turned back while his noble looking head is held high. His all black coat glistens in the late afternoon sun. His face displays a strong confidence with his nostrils flared, his veins bulging from his cheek bones, and his fiery black eyes burning holes into the souls of those who stare into them. His neck muscles are tensed and thickened with adrenalin. His black main is thrown into the wind like a flag rippling in the winds of a tornado. His muscular front legs are brought up to his chest displaying his flashing gray hooves that could crush a man's scull with one blow. His backbone and underbelly are held almost straight up and his hind quarters are tensed. His back legs are spread apart for balance. His back hooves are pressed into the earth; therefore, his hooves cause deep gouges from the weight of his body on the soil. His black tail is held straight down and every once in a while a burst of wind catches it and then it floats down back into place like an elegant piece of silk falling from the sky. His bravery and strength are what made his breed prized as a warhorse. NarrativeDescriptiveLiteraryExpositoryPersuasive3. In Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, Boo Radley's reputation comes not from anything he has done, but rather from the lack of information that the community has about him. Boo Radley is virtually unknown in the community. After getting into trouble with the police, Boo “was not seen again for 15 years” (p. 9). Mr Radley ensures that Boo remains hidden and as a result, he is completely mysterious to people in Maycomb. Because of the mystery surrounding his character, the community begins to blame Boo for unexplained events. Boo gets held responsible for things he's not involved in including “any stealthy crime committed in Maycomb” (p.9). It seems that the town of Maycomb, when looking for someone to Blame, look to Boo because they know so little about him. As time goes own and the mystery increases, the children in the town start to create myths around Boo Radley. Jem claims to Dill that he “dine[s] on raw squirrels” (p.14). The children have heard the stories and so their imaginations run wild and begin to turn Boo into a kind of mythical creature. Everything about him is exaggerated. Boo Radley may well be unusual, but most of the things that people in the town of Maycomb say about are not based in fact, they are simply stories that have developed because he is unknown. NarrativeDescriptiveLiteraryExpositoryPersuasive4. People often think all planets are alike, but there are actually three types of planets in the solar system. The terrestrial planets are made of rock and metal and are closest to the sun. These include the midsize planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. They rotate slowly and don’t have many moons. Farther from the sun are the planets called gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They are called gas giants because they are formed from gases such as hydrogen and helium. Gas giants rotate fast and have many moons. Finally, planetoids are objects made up of rock and ice and are too small to be true “planets.” Planetoids sometimes even get pulled into a planet’s gravitational field and become moons themselves. Whether they are terrestrials, gas giants, or planetoids, the planets in the solar system are fascinating. NarrativeDescriptiveLiteraryExpositoryPersuasive5. Immigration contributes to the overall health of the American economy. Despite recent concerns expressed about illegal and some legal immigration to the United States, this country has largely benefited from the skills, talents, and ambition that immigrants bring with them. American businesses gain from a good source of affordable labor, while towns and cities are revitalized by immigrant families who strengthen communities through civic participation and the generation of new economic activity. The United States must continue to welcome new arrivals and help those who are already here; otherwise, the country will lose the advantages it has over other industrialized countries that compete against us in the global marketplace and seek to recruit from a vast pool of unskilled and skilled global workers.

In the spring, toads lay their eggs in ponds, lakes and puddles. Then, tinytadpoles come out of the eggs. The tadpoles live in the water for several weeks.Next, the tadpoles start to develop back legs, and then front legs. Finally, thetadpoles lose their tails. They are ready to come out of the water--as tiny, tinytoads!2. Saturn is the second largest planet in the solar system, much larger thanEarth. It is mostly made of hydrogen. It rotates more quickly too. A day on Saturn isonly about 10 Earth hours long. But it takes about 30 of our years to make one fulltrip around the sun.3.A beech tree has very smooth bark. Unfortunately, this can cause aproblem for the tree. Sometimes people decide that they want to write their namesin the bark. When they do this, they can harm the tree. Diseases can attack the treethrough the cuts in the bark. Trees can die because of these diseases.4. Coral snakes are distinguished by their red, yellow/white, and blackcolored banding. Most species of are small in size. North American species averagearound 3 feet in length, but specimens of up to 5 feet or slightly larger have beenreported5. In most parts of the world, there are not as many crocodiles as there usedto be. This is the problem because crocodiles are becoming endangered and alsocrocodiles necessary to he balance of nature. Many crocodiles have died becausepeople dried up the swamps and marshes where the crocodiles live. Poachers havealso contributed to the dilemma as crocodiles have been desired for their strong,smooth, leathery skins. In order to preserve these mighty creatures, people musttake care of the crocodiles' environment and help put a stop to the needlessshooting of these animals.​</h2><br />
