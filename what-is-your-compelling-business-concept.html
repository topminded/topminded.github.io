It wasn't just thinking; it's more profound than the surface of what is known to everyone. What fuels this is our curiosity, our fascination with certain things, and our passion for life. We were compelled to think philosophically when we criticized everything we have in life, every truth, and every fact we gathered.</p><p></p><p>A person was born with a well-developed curiosity. It's a part of our life to question things that are confusing and unknown to everyone. Life didn't serve knowledge to us on a silver platter. We gained it by constant thinking and seeking answers. Philosophical thinking is a part of how we grow up; it's the development of our minds.</p><br />

                            20. what are the reasons that compel to engage in philosophical thinking? ​</h2><br />
                        <p>The answer is in your question—REASON. But the terms PERSON and COMPELS are what makes this question controversial…and interesting!</p><p></p><p>Socrates said to Theaetetus, “Philosophy begins in wonder” (155c) and that would be a great answer. But, children wonder and many educators are quick to point out that adults lose that sense of mental inquisitiveness as they grow older. But wonder is not endlessly asking questions—as anyone who spends time around children has discovered…”Are we there yet?” Likewise, chimpanzees (non-persons) are rather curious beings too, are they not? Humans are often compared to them as sharing a high percentage of genetics (there are remarkable similarities), but a significant discovery is found by simply asking, “ After all, no ape claimed that ‘philosophy begins in wonder’ so being a PERSON is necessary for philosophical thinking!</p><br />

                            21. 1. Enumerate the macro and micro sources of business opportunities. 2. What are the common methods of generating ideas? 3. What are the business opportunity elements that the entrepreneur should look for in screening the top compelling opportunities among the list of vast opportunities?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong>Refers to the big or macro forces that affect the area, the industry, and the market , which the enterprise belongs to.</p><p>-influence how business should be conducted, how consumers will behave, how supply and demand will move, how different competitors would position themselves, and how the cost of doing business will proceed.</p><p></p><p>Micro and macro environments have a significant impact on the success of marketing activities, and therefore such environmental factors must be considered in-depth during the process of creating a strategic marketing plan. Considering these factors will improve the success of your organisation’s marketing campaign and the reputation of the brand in the long term.</p><p></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong>To understand why both microeconomic and macroeconomic perspectives are useful, consider the problem of studying a biological ecosystem like a lake. One person who sets out to study the lake might focus on specific topics: certain kinds of algae or plant life; the characteristics of particular fish or snails; or the trees surrounding the lake. Another person might take an overall view and instead consider the entire ecosystem of the lake from top to bottom; what eats what, how the system stays in a rough balance, and what environmental stresses affect this balance. Both approaches are useful, and both examine the same lake, but the viewpoints are different. In a similar way, both microeconomics and macroeconomics study the same economy, but each has a different viewpoint.</p><p></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>5 Factors to Use When Evaluating a Business Opportunity</strong></p><p></p><p>Many of us are faced with business opportunities on a regular basis. Deciding what’s worth embracing, though, can be difficult. Whether you’re starting a new business or whether you’re trying to expand your current business with a new opportunity, it’s vital to know how to appropriately evaluate it.</p><p>As you look forward, here are some things to consider when deciding whether a business opportunity is worth embracing:</p><p></p><p></p><p>1. Market Size</p><p></p><p>One of the most important factors when evaluating a business opportunity is market size. Do a little market research. Figure out if there is a market for the opportunity — and how big that market is.</p><p>Before you move forward, you want to be sure the demand is there. You don’t need to appeal to a massive market, but it does help if you understand the market. Additionally, knowing how engaged the market is and how likely they are to pay for what’s being sold can help.</p><p></p><p>2. Relationships</p><p></p><p>Does the business opportunity come with some relationships? For example, do you have an “in” that can help you leverage the opportunity? If you know someone who is technically minded, that can help you with certain aspects of the opportunity. What are your relationships with potential investors or customers? When you have more relationships, the opportunity is likely to run smoother.</p><p></p><p>3. Ability to Manage Cash Flow</p><p></p><p>Next, you need to look at the ability to manage cash flow. Is there start-up funding for the business? What about ways to keep funding the business each month. Figure out how the cash flow will be managed, and take a look at the business plan. You want to make sure that the business is likely to sustain itself after a period of time.</p><p></p><p>4. Management Skillsets</p><p></p><p>What are the skillsets of those involved? If you are evaluating your own business opportunity, you need to be honest about what you bring to the table, and what you need to make up for. When looking for a business opportunity to invest in, or expand into, look at the management. What skills do they have? Are they appropriate and diversified? Do you trust the competence of the principals to make the opportunity a success?</p><p></p><p>5. Passion and Persistence</p><p></p><p>Even if there is a bit of a talent deficit, it’s possible, in some cases, to make up for that with passion and persistence. Are you working with people who will get the job done?</p><p>Do you trust that they have the passion to make things happen? Will they approach problems with a can-do attitude in order to solve them?</p><p>When dealing with your own startup, you need to make sure you have the passion and persistence for the opportunity. Will you push through even though things get a little dark? If you’ve done your research, and you are confident in your team and your plan, then being able to push through is vital.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes You Have to Say No</p><p></p><p>Once you’re done evaluating the business opportunity, it’s time to decide whether it’s a good idea to make a move. Sometimes, the answer is no. Going through the exercise can help you make these decisions faster — before you waste too much time on “opportunities” that really aren’t.</p><p></p><p><strong>HOPE</strong><strong> </strong><strong>IT</strong><strong> </strong><strong>HELPSS</strong><strong> </strong><strong>YOU</strong><strong>!</strong></p><br />
