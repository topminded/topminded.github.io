The car that they want to buy costs P 800,000.00 while the house costs P 3,000,000.00. According to economists, the depreciation rate of car is 15% annually while the appreciation rate of houses in the Philippines is 2.4% annually. If after 10 years they want to sell both, how much will be their money?​</p>

                                            Reynold's World Reynold's story is not new. It's a story that is echoed in most developing countries around the world. The recent UNICEF report The State of the World's Children 2012. Children in an Urban World reveal that globally, urbanization leaves hundreds of millions of children in cities and towns excluded from vital services. Already the Philippines is an urban society with half the population or 45 million people living in cities. Of Metro Manila's 11 million people, 1.7 million children live in informal settlements. "Children who live in the poorest urban communities in the Philippines experience multiple deprivations. They lack decent housing, are exposed to dangers from disasters, have limited access to clean water and are more prone to neglect, abuse and exploitation. Each excluded child represents a missed opportunity at achieving a stable and productive society, "Dr. Abdul Alim, UNICEF Deputy Representative, says. Cities offer many children the advantages of urban schools, clinics and playgrounds. Yet the same cities the world over are also the settings for some of the greatest disparities in children's health, education and opportunities. Infrastructure and services are not keeping up with urban growth in many regions and children's basic needs are not being met. Families living in poverty often pay more for substandard services. Water, for instance, can cost 50 times more in poor neighborhoods where residents have to buy it from private vendors than it costs in wealthier neighborhoods where households are connected directly to water mains. The deprivations endured by children in poor urban communities are often obscured by broad statistical averages that lump together all city dwellers - rich and poor alike. When averages such as these are used in making urban policy and allocating resources, the needs of the poorest can be overlooked. 1. If you were in the same situation, what would you do?2.

                                            Reynold's World Reynold's story is not new. It's a story that is echoed in most developing countries around the world. The recent UNICEF report The State of the World's Children 2012. Children in an Urban World reveal that globally, urbanization leaves hundreds of millions of children in cities and towns excluded from vital services. Already the Philippines is an urban society with half the population or 45 million people living in cities. Of Metro Manila's 11 million people, 1.7 million children live in informal settlements. "Children who live in the poorest urban communities in the Philippines experience multiple deprivations. They lack decent housing, are exposed to dangers from disasters, have limited access to clean water and are more prone to neglect, abuse and exploitation. Each excluded child represents a missed opportunity at achieving a stable and productive society, "Dr. Abdul Alim, UNICEF Deputy Representative, says. Cities offer many children the advantages of urban schools, clinics and playgrounds. Yet the same cities the world over are also the settings for some of the greatest disparities in children's health, education and opportunities. Infrastructure and services are not keeping up with urban growth in many regions and children's basic needs are not being met. Families living in poverty often pay more for substandard services. Water, for instance, can cost 50 times more in poor neighborhoods where residents have to buy it from private vendors than it costs in wealthier neighborhoods where households are connected directly to water mains. The deprivations endured by children in poor urban communities are often obscured by broad statistical averages that lump together all city dwellers - rich and poor alike. When averages such as these are used in making urban policy and allocating resources, the needs of the poorest can be overlooked.Questions: 1. If you were in the same situation, what would you do? 2.

Already the Philippines is an urban society with half the population or 45 million people living in cities. Of Metro Manila's 11 million people, 1.7 million children live in informal settlements. "Children who live in the poorest urban communities in the Philippines experience multiple deprivations. They lack decent housing, are exposed to dangers from disasters, have limited access to clean water and are more prone to neglect, abuse and exploitation. Each excluded child represents a missed opportunity at achieving a stable and productive society, "Dr. Abdul Alim, UNICEF Deputy Representative, says. Cities offer many children the advantages of urban schools, clinics and playgrounds. Yet the same cities the world over are also the settings for some of the greatest disparities in children's health, education and opportunities. Infrastructure and services are not keeping up with urban growth in many regions and children's basic needs are not being met. Families living in poverty often pay more for substandard services. Water, for instance, can cost 50 times more in poor neighborhoods where residents have to buy it from private vendors than it costs in wealthier neighborhoods where households are connected directly to water mains. The deprivations endured by children in poor urban communities are often obscured by broad statistical averages that lump together all city dwellers - rich and poor alike. When averages such as these are used in making urban policy and allocating resources, the needs of the poorest can be overlooked. 1. If you were in the same situation, what would you do?2.

                            11. Reynold's World Reynold's story is not new. It's a story that is echoed in most developing countries around the world. The recent UNICEF report The State of the World's Children 2012. Children in an Urban World reveal that globally, urbanization leaves hundreds of millions of children in cities and towns excluded from vital services. Already the Philippines is an urban society with half the population or 45 million people living in cities. Of Metro Manila's 11 million people, 1.7 million children live in informal settlements. "Children who live in the poorest urban communities in the Philippines experience multiple deprivations. They lack decent housing, are exposed to dangers from disasters, have limited access to clean water and are more prone to neglect, abuse and exploitation. Each excluded child represents a missed opportunity at achieving a stable and productive society, "Dr. Abdul Alim, UNICEF Deputy Representative, says.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>NOTE: answers for number 1 and 2 are connected </p><p>I will have a serious talk with the government officials and let them realized how big and crucial the matter is. Since the report really have statistical figures, this means that it is a valid report that needs immediate action. The life of the children are at stake. In our country we can see the big gap between the rich and the poor children. We can see a lot of children in the street and sometime even asking for money in jeepneys. </p><p>It is better to start with a project that will answer the problem of poverty. Most of the families that belong to informal settlers came to the city to find for a better life opportunity. If we can provide them with jobs, a proper shelter and a clean water, maybe their lives will change. </p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</p><br />
