                                            Near the end of the 19th century, 35-year-old Jose Rizal turned into the Philippines' most beloved hero when he was martyred by the Spanish colonial government at Bagumbayan. He died an extraordinary man of his times: renowned novelist, poet, ophthalmologist, journalist, and linguist. But behind these achievements, there remained the story of a man every Filipinocan relate and connect to. Like today's overseas Filipino, Rizal needed to leave his family to fulfill his studies and career abroad, suffering from homesickness, and enduring a long-distance relationship with the woman he loved most. He was also the best example of the Filipino who came back home and used the knowledge and skills he learned abroad to help improve the lives of his family and countrymen.1. Title of the movie2.

                            1.  Can you give example of it?Businesses that have specialized knowledge difficult to acquire but necessary to sell the product, for use, or enjoyment of the product. This takes careful handling because you can't just place this knowledge on your Web site.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Every business needs a reason for their customers to buy from them and not their competitors. This is called a Unique Sales Proposition (USP). Your USP can be identified by completing the phrase "Customers will buy from me because my business is the only..."</p><p></p><p>Your USP can change as your business or your market changes, and you can have different USPs for different types of customer.</p><p></p><p>For example:</p><p></p><p>a stationery store could offer a free same-day delivery service for its business customers within a local area - an effective USP for businesses that need fast delivery</p><p>the same stationery store could offer a 5 per cent discount to businesses that spend more than $1,000 a month - this would be a USP for cost-conscious customers</p><p>the stationery store could also make sure it offers the most comprehensive stock of artists' materials in the area - a USP for local professional or amateur artists</p><p>All of these USPs can be effective because they are driven by what the customer looks for when making a buying decision.</p><p></p><p>It's a good idea to review your USPs regularly. Can you tailor your products or services to better match your customers' needs? Consider asking your customers why they buy from you. This will tell you what they think your USP is - this may differ from what you think your USP is.</p><p></p><p>It's also useful to check constantly what your competition is doing. Remember - if your competitors are doing the same, your USP isn't unique any more.</p><p></p><br />

                            9. Near the end of the 19th century, 35-year-old Jose Rizal turned into the Philippines' most beloved hero when he was martyred by the Spanish colonial government at Bagumbayan. He died an extraordinary man of his times: renowned novelist, poet, ophthalmologist, journalist, and linguist. But behind these achievements, there remained the story of a man every Filipinocan relate and connect to. Like today's overseas Filipino, Rizal needed to leave his family to fulfill his studies and career abroad, suffering from homesickness, and enduring a long-distance relationship with the woman he loved most. He was also the best example of the Filipino who came back home and used the knowledge and skills he learned abroad to help improve the lives of his family and countrymen.1. Title of the movie2.
