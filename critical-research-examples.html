Be wary of photos and videos which may show real events but can be miscaptioned, or they may be representing historical events rather than current ones.

Finding out the truth takes time.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes the truth is stranger than fiction, but often stories that seem preposterous are from fake news sources. Before you share a story, or cite it in your research, take some time to find out if it is real. Many people share stories before they even read them. Not all "fake news" is created equal. Misinformation are falsehoods that are unintentional, perhaps because of a reporting error, or because something was shared before it was properly verified.

Quantitative research is original, systematic and objective research that collectsnumerical data and uses logic and statistical analysis to verify hypothesis.6. A researcher should explore the characteristics of the data and the examinedvariables to summarize the data once it is reliable and ready for investigation.7. Quantitative research uses statistics to generalize a finding.8. The first step for a researcher after finishing data collection is to start hypothesistesting procedures.9. Research analysis is the last critical step in the research process.10. A valid research refers to the degree to which it accurately measures what itintends to measure.11.
