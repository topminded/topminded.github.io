What is the ‘greenhouse effect?’ 3. What is the evidence of global warming? 4. How will the weather change? 5. What is the international community doing? A. Sea levels have risen by 10 – 20 cm. This is due to the expansion of warming oceans. Temperature records show that the average temperature has increased by about 0.6ºC in the 20th century. B. The Kyoto Protocol (1997) commits industrialised countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. It suffered a huge set back in 2001 when the USA, responsible for a quarter of global emissions, pulled out. C. The planet’s climate is constantly changing but now scientists believe that the extreme changes taking place today are a result of human activity. The changes we see today may affect the stability of the climate on which much life on the planet depends. D. The term refers to the role played by the layer of gases, including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, which trap the heat from the sun in the earth’s atmosphere. We need the layer to keep in some of the heat but now the concentration of gases, especially CO2 is increasing and retaining more heat. E. It is difficult to predict, but we can expect more extreme weather conditions like floods, storms and heat waves. Scientists believe there will be more rain but also a higher risk of drought in inland areas​</a>

                        Importance of Communication in Globalization
<p>
Due to the various channels used to easily transmit and receive messages, communication is also an essential component of globalization. Because of eye contacts, body language, and proximity, in-person business communication will aid in the development of productive relationships. Globalization is thus characterized as the democratization and unification of the world's society, environment, and infrastructure. Globalization is thus characterized as the convergence and democratization of the world's society, environment, and technology by transnational investment, the rapid diffusion of communication and information technologies, and the effects of free markets on local, regional, and national economies.
</p><p>
</p><p>Education, commerce, and partnerships are all aided by communication. It also encourages international interaction and the settlement of conflicts. People may express themselves by communication, which leads to social and psychological well-being. Globalization refers to the worldwide interconnection between individuals and enterprises, which inevitably contributes to cultural, political, and economic convergence. That is the freedom to travel across the globe and deal freely with others in order to do foreign business. World problems that may have an impact on communication include: the abrupt emergence of issues in particular countries—this may have an impact on communication by prohibiting citizens from entering their countries or cutting off communications.
</p><p>
</p><p>We depend heavily on exchanging knowledge in today's hectic environment, so learning strong communication skills is more important than ever. In order to convey and interpret information efficiently and correctly, good verbal and written communication skills are required.

One of the most recent human rights on which international relations should be based so that those who suffer or have less benefit from the help of the more affluent. This was one of the main reasons that led the United Nations General Assembly in December 2005 to proclaim 20 December of each year as the International Day of Human Solidarity.</p><p> </p><p></p><p>It is a quality that is based on equality, inclusion and social justice and that entails a mutual commitment and obligation among the various members of society and the global community.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Globalization and information and communication technology (ICT) continue to change us and the world we live in. Nursing stands at an opportunity intersection where challenging global health issues, an international workforce shortage, and massive growth of ICT combine to create a very unique space for nursing leadership and nursing intervention.

Attention to lessons learned will assist in combating the technological apartheid that is already present in many areas of the globe and will highlight opportunities for innovative applications in health. ICT has opened new channels of communication, creating the beginnings of a global information society that will facilitate access to isolated areas where health needs are extreme and where nursing can contribute significantly to the achievement of “Health for All.” The purpose of this article is to discuss the relationships between globalization, health, and ICT, and to illuminate opportunities for nursing in this flattening and increasingly interconnected world.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps!!</p><br />

What is the ‘greenhouse effect?’ 3. What is the evidence of global warming? 4. How will the weather change? 5. What is the international community doing? A. Sea levels have risen by 10 – 20 cm. This is due to the expansion of warming oceans. Temperature records show that the average temperature has increased by about 0.6ºC in the 20th century. B. The Kyoto Protocol (1997) commits industrialised countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. It suffered a huge set back in 2001 when the USA, responsible for a quarter of global emissions, pulled out. C. The planet’s climate is constantly changing but now scientists believe that the extreme changes taking place today are a result of human activity. The changes we see today may affect the stability of the climate on which much life on the planet depends. D. The term refers to the role played by the layer of gases, including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, which trap the heat from the sun in the earth’s atmosphere. We need the layer to keep in some of the heat but now the concentration of gases, especially CO2 is increasing and retaining more heat. E. It is difficult to predict, but we can expect more extreme weather conditions like floods, storms and heat waves. Scientists believe there will be more rain but also a higher risk of drought in inland areas​</h2><br />

                            28. 1. Discuss what is the difference between global and local community. 2. Cite at least 3 examples of community members who are present in your barangay (ex. Barangay tanod, barangay health workers, etc.), Explain their roles and functions. 3. Am I a responsible/productive members of my community? 4. What role am I playing in our community? 5. Am I making my community better?​</h2><br />
                        <p>1) The main difference between global and local communities is their scope and scale. A global community refers to a group of people connected by a common interest, goal or identity that transcends geographical boundaries. It includes people from different parts of the world who share a common goal or concern, such as human rights, climate change, or social justice. On the other hand, a local community refers to a group of people who share a common geographical location, such as a neighborhood, village, or town. The members of a local community interact more frequently and are more connected to each other through shared experiences and resources.</p><p></p><p>2) Examples of community members who are present in a barangay may include barangay tanod, barangay health workers, and barangay officials. Barangay tanod serves as the community's peace and order officers, while barangay health workers provide healthcare services and medical assistance to residents. Barangay officials, on the other hand, are elected officials who manage the barangay's affairs and ensure that government programs and services are delivered to the residents.</p><p></p><p>3) A guide to answer this question: To determine if you are a responsible/productive member of your community, you need to evaluate how you contribute to the community's growth and development. Ask yourself if you actively participate in community activities, follow rules and regulations, and support initiatives that benefit the community. Do you volunteer for community service projects, attend meetings and forums, and actively seek ways to improve your skills and knowledge? If yes, then you can consider yourself as a responsible and productive member of your community.</p><p></p><p>4) As an individual, your role in the community may vary depending on your skills, interests, and resources. Some examples of roles that you can play in the community include a volunteer, advocate, mentor, leader, and organizer. You can also contribute to the community by supporting local businesses, promoting cultural and artistic events, and being an active member of local groups and organizations.</p><p></p><p>5) Making your community better requires a collective effort from all members. You can contribute to the community's improvement by actively participating in community activities, supporting local businesses, volunteering for community service projects, and being a responsible citizen. By doing so, you can help build a stronger, more resilient, and more vibrant community that benefits everyone.</p><br />
