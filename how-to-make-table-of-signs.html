                                            For about 3 a.m. early in the morning at Leon Hernandez Hospital, two boys rushed through the E.R. carrying a lady. “Help! Can you help us?” one called. Immediately Bea the new intern and a nurse rushed them into an exam room. “What happened?” Bea asked while examining the patient. “We don’t know!” the male student sobbed. “Brittany started feeling sick at a party last night. She came home and went to sleep, but then couldn’t wake up this morning. She was acting so weird we decided to bring her here. ”Bea carefully observed the lady lying on the table. She was rolling her head and clearly seemed confused. However, there were no obvious signs of trauma. “Has this taken any drugs recently?” Bea asked. The two students hesitated and looked at each other. Finally one of them nodded. “I think she took some Ecstasy last night.” Bea thought for a moment. Ecstasy had been fairly popular on the party scene for several years now. She had seen people on the drug become somewhat confused, but not delirious. Maybe the lady was having an adverse reaction to the drug. It was a start. To be safe, Bea ordered a series of blood tests. In the meantime, she checked her medical references to find out as much as she could about how Ecstasy affected the body. Bea spoke to the students in the waiting area. “Did your classmates have much to drink last evening?” “Just one beer,” replied one. “She had a test today and wanted to study. She did drink a lot of water. You’re supposed to do that to prevent a hangover aren’t you? She seemed really thirsty.” Bea thought for a minute. Normally, the patient’s kidneys would respond to drinking a lot of water by producing large amounts of dilute urine. However, Ecstasy acts as an anti-diuretic and forces the kidneys to make concentrated urine instead. This would prevent patient’s body from getting rid of excess water and could cause her electrolytes to fall. Could this be causing her symptoms? ​</a>

                                            Sarah stared at the mess she had made on the floor. In her disappointment she wanted to throw everything and forget what she was doing. She knew she should have listened to her mother when she was explaining how to wrap presents. It was her best friend Amy’s birthday and the party was in two hours. How would she ever get the gifts to look nice before then? The boxes she had wrapped looked like her two-year-old brother had wrapped them. Even the card she had written and signed looked messy. Sarah took a deep breath. As much as she wanted to wrap the gifts all by herself, she swallowed her pride, but still undecided, called for her mother. When her mother walked-in she took one glance at the gifts and said, “Look like it’s time for a redo!”With her mother’s help Sarah slowly rewrapped each present and retied each bow listening carefully to each direction. Her mother even helped her remake the card. Sarah rewrote the message and added sparkly stickers to the paper. “Thanks, mom,” Sarah said. “I couldn’t have done this without you. I guess I learned my lessons. I should have listened to you the first time. Thanks for helping me redo everything.” “No problem,” mom said. “All of us need a redo every now and then.” When Sarah arrived at the party, she had the best-wrapped presents on the table. “Thank you for the gift, Sarah. You are such an adorable friend,” Amy exclaimed.         Let’s Talk!1. Who was the girl in the selection? __________________________________2.

                            5. 1. Drawing pencil - this is one of the most important
tools in drawing. It comes in various grades. Proper
to handle is more or less 60 degrees.
 A. Hard pencils – are used where extreme accuracy
 is required especially working on graphs,
 diagrams and charts. H – hard pencils: H, 2H, 3H,
 4H, up to 9H ( the hardest).
 B. Medium pencils – are used for general purpose
 work in drawing. HB &amp; F – between the hard &amp;
 soft.
 C. Soft pencils – are too soft to be used in
 mechanical drafting. They are very useful for art
 work of various kinds.
 B – soft pencils: B, 2B, 3B, 4B, 5B &amp; 6B ( the
 softest ).
2. Eraser - This is used to clean the dirt off the drawing. A soft eraser is advantageous in removing
smudges and pencil marks, whereas, a harder eraser
is useful for making changes and correcting errors in
the drawing.
3. Erasing Shield - This tool is made up of metal with
irregular holes. It is a useful tool to protect the rest of the
drawing when clearing up smudges, unnecessary pencil
lines and other erasures.
4. Pencil sharpener - will be used whenever they show
sign of dullness. Various types and designs are available in the store for use.
5. Masking tape - This is used for fastening the drawing
paper on the drawing table or drawing board because it
does not damage the board and it will not damage the
paper if it is removed by pulling it off.
6. Drawing paper - Different types of drawing papers
are available for use but hard and soft surface drawing
papers are highly recommended to be the best. This
type does not groove easily when pressure is applied to
the pencil. Oslo paper is commonly used but bond paper is also recommended.
7. T-Square - It is a drawing instrument used when making horizontal lines. It is also used for guiding triangles
when drawing vertical lines. It is made of wood, plastic
or the combination of both. when carrying the T-square.

A. Fixed Head. The head is fastened to the
 blade. It is used for ordinary work.
B. Movable Head or Adjustable Head. It has
one
 fixed and one adjustable head and used only
 for occasional drawing.
 C. Detachable Head or Removable Head. It is
 designed for comfort .
8. Triangle - Used to draw vertical &amp; slanting line. It
is usually made of plastic and comes in different
sizes. If in use, the base of the triangle must rest
on the blade of the T-square.
 Commonly used triangles are:
 A. 30 degrees X 60 degrees
 B. 45 degrees X 45 degrees
9. Compass - This drawing instrument is used when
drawing arcs and circles. It is used in a similar
way to a divider. It is composed of one with the
pen leg and the needle point leg being held together with a handle. Hold the handle and draw a
circle.
10. Divider - This is a drawing instrument used when
transferring measurements, dividing lines and
arcs into the desired number of equal parts. It can
easily transfer accurate measurements by adjust-
11. Protractor - It is a semi-circular instrument
divided into 180 equal parts, each of which is
called a degree. It is used to determine
graduations of the degrees when measuring arcs,
angles and circles. High quality protractor is
usually made of plastic.
12. Drawing Board/Table - The vertical edges of the
board and table, which must be straight, are
called working edges since the head of the
 T-Square slides against them. Drawing board

                            6. For about 3 a.m. early in the morning at Leon Hernandez Hospital, two boys rushed through the E.R. carrying a lady. “Help! Can you help us?” one called. Immediately Bea the new intern and a nurse rushed them into an exam room. “What happened?” Bea asked while examining the patient. “We don’t know!” the male student sobbed. “Brittany started feeling sick at a party last night. She came home and went to sleep, but then couldn’t wake up this morning. She was acting so weird we decided to bring her here. ”Bea carefully observed the lady lying on the table. She was rolling her head and clearly seemed confused. However, there were no obvious signs of trauma. “Has this taken any drugs recently?” Bea asked. The two students hesitated and looked at each other. Finally one of them nodded. “I think she took some Ecstasy last night.” Bea thought for a moment. Ecstasy had been fairly popular on the party scene for several years now. She had seen people on the drug become somewhat confused, but not delirious. Maybe the lady was having an adverse reaction to the drug. It was a start. To be safe, Bea ordered a series of blood tests. In the meantime, she checked her medical references to find out as much as she could about how Ecstasy affected the body. Bea spoke to the students in the waiting area. “Did your classmates have much to drink last evening?” “Just one beer,” replied one. “She had a test today and wanted to study. She did drink a lot of water. You’re supposed to do that to prevent a hangover aren’t you? She seemed really thirsty.” Bea thought for a minute. Normally, the patient’s kidneys would respond to drinking a lot of water by producing large amounts of dilute urine. However, Ecstasy acts as an anti-diuretic and forces the kidneys to make concentrated urine instead. This would prevent patient’s body from getting rid of excess water and could cause her electrolytes to fall. Could this be causing her symptoms? ​</h2><br />

                            11. Sarah stared at the mess she had made on the floor. In her disappointment she wanted to throw everything and forget what she was doing. She knew she should have listened to her mother when she was explaining how to wrap presents. It was her best friend Amy’s birthday and the party was in two hours. How would she ever get the gifts to look nice before then? The boxes she had wrapped looked like her two-year-old brother had wrapped them. Even the card she had written and signed looked messy. Sarah took a deep breath. As much as she wanted to wrap the gifts all by herself, she swallowed her pride, but still undecided, called for her mother. When her mother walked-in she took one glance at the gifts and said, “Look like it’s time for a redo!”With her mother’s help Sarah slowly rewrapped each present and retied each bow listening carefully to each direction.
