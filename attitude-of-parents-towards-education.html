                                            Abstract
The COVID-19 crisis has forced education systems worldwide to find alternatives to face-to-face instruction. As a result, online teaching and learning have been used by teachers and students on an unprecedented scale. Since lockdowns – either massive or localised - may be needed again in the future to respond to new waves of the infection until a vaccine becomes available, it is of utmost importance for governments to identify which policies can maximise the effectiveness of online learning. This policy brief examines the role of students’ attitudes towards learning in maximising the potential of online schooling when regular face-to-face instruction cannot take place. Since parents and teachers play a fundamental role in supporting students to develop these crucial attitudes, particularly in the current situation, targeted policy interventions should be designed with the aim of reducing the burden on parents and help teachers and schools make the most of digital learning.</a>

                                            Television and childrenTelevision has become an integral part of a child's life. For the last thirty years, it has been transforming people'slives. It has an effect on almost every aspect of modern life. Although television may be used to educate children, programswith little or no educational value are commonly on broadcast.Experts are disturbed about the viewpoint that children are learning from television, typically, parents, classrooms,and churches have served as role models and educators for children.Since television has such a strong impact on children's attitudes and behavior, its presence in culture is growing inimportance - it is much more than a mere leisure practice. According to child psychologist Robert M. Liebert "the tool haschanged childhood more than any other psychological breakthrough in the history of the world."Another effect on media is extreme violence exposure. Children can become more violent as a result of watchingtelevision crime, according to many reports. Furthermore, when children are exposed to so much abuse on ty, they growused to it as the only alternative to tough circumstances. Children who are exposed to a lot of violence on TV may developapathy toward real aggression.A study conducted by Ronald S. Drabman has shown that compared to a control group, children who watched anaggressive television broadcast were slower to ask for adult help when a fight broke out among younger children.Children are probably influenced by clever ads directed at them. Dr. Dale Roeck claims that exposing children totoo much high-powered ads of sugar-rich products on tv puts their oral wellbeing at risk which, of course, has a detrimentalimpact on good diet."Almost half of the items that television sells to kids are products that people who care for kids believe shouldn't bepurchased in the first place," according to another expert Kids who are very young do not know the difference betweenadvertisements and programmes.1.What is the claim of the author?2.Write three effects of television to the children3.Does the reasoning of the author sound or valid?

                                            According to Anna Freud of National Centre for Children and Families, discrimination is when a person is treated unfairly because of who they are, this can have a detrimental effect on their mental health, their self-esteem and educational performance. Disability, age discrimination, race, skin color and sex, religious discrimination, gender identity, place of birth and status as a parent etc., are one of the many critical situations that can lead to discrimination which cannot be undone but can be minimized through learning to be responsible on making value judgements. It is important to understand what value judgement is. Value judgement is a judgement of the rightness or wrongness of something, or someone based on a comparison or other relativity or of the usefulness of something or someone. It does not simply describe the world; they prescribe certain attitudes or behaviors toward the world. It is based more on perceptual understanding on a certain issue; a claim that a particular human action or object has some degree of importance, worth or desirability. 2022.04.13 18:41​</a>

                            10. Abstract
The COVID-19 crisis has forced education systems worldwide to find alternatives to face-to-face instruction. As a result, online teaching and learning have been used by teachers and students on an unprecedented scale. Since lockdowns – either massive or localised - may be needed again in the future to respond to new waves of the infection until a vaccine becomes available, it is of utmost importance for governments to identify which policies can maximise the effectiveness of online learning. This policy brief examines the role of students’ attitudes towards learning in maximising the potential of online schooling when regular face-to-face instruction cannot take place. Since parents and teachers play a fundamental role in supporting students to develop these crucial attitudes, particularly in the current situation, targeted policy interventions should be designed with the aim of reducing the burden on parents and help teachers and schools make the most of digital learning.</h2><br />

                            13. Television and childrenTelevision has become an integral part of a child's life. For the last thirty years, it has been transforming people'slives. It has an effect on almost every aspect of modern life. Although television may be used to educate children, programswith little or no educational value are commonly on broadcast.Experts are disturbed about the viewpoint that children are learning from television, typically, parents, classrooms,and churches have served as role models and educators for children.Since television has such a strong impact on children's attitudes and behavior, its presence in culture is growing inimportance - it is much more than a mere leisure practice. According to child psychologist Robert M. Liebert "the tool haschanged childhood more than any other psychological breakthrough in the history of the world."Another effect on media is extreme violence exposure. Children can become more violent as a result of watchingtelevision crime, according to many reports. Furthermore, when children are exposed to so much abuse on ty, they growused to it as the only alternative to tough circumstances. Children who are exposed to a lot of violence on TV may developapathy toward real aggression.A study conducted by Ronald S. Drabman has shown that compared to a control group, children who watched anaggressive television broadcast were slower to ask for adult help when a fight broke out among younger children.Children are probably influenced by clever ads directed at them. Dr. Dale Roeck claims that exposing children totoo much high-powered ads of sugar-rich products on tv puts their oral wellbeing at risk which, of course, has a detrimentalimpact on good diet."Almost half of the items that television sells to kids are products that people who care for kids believe shouldn't bepurchased in the first place," according to another expert Kids who are very young do not know the difference betweenadvertisements and programmes.1.What is the claim of the author?2.Write three effects of television to the children3.Does the reasoning of the author sound or valid?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.The claim of the author is do not spoil your children watching tv cause you may not know if it's educational or dirty behavior.</p><p></p><p>2.Bad behavior, Cursing (because of hearing some bad words in dramas), Violence ( Because of watching to much action movies)</p><p></p><p>3.Valid</p><p></p><p>(Sorry sa wrong grammar)</p><br />

                            14. According to Anna Freud of National Centre for Children and Families, discrimination is when a person is treated unfairly because of who they are, this can have a detrimental effect on their mental health, their self-esteem and educational performance. Disability, age discrimination, race, skin color and sex, religious discrimination, gender identity, place of birth and status as a parent etc., are one of the many critical situations that can lead to discrimination which cannot be undone but can be minimized through learning to be responsible on making value judgements. It is important to understand what value judgement is. Value judgement is a judgement of the rightness or wrongness of something, or someone based on a comparison or other relativity or of the usefulness of something or someone. It does not simply describe the world; they prescribe certain attitudes or behaviors toward the world. It is based more on perceptual understanding on a certain issue; a claim that a particular human action or object has some degree of importance, worth or desirability. 2022.04.13 18:41​</h2><br />
