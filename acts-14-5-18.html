1. The net force acting on an object is directly proportional to its mass.
2. Force is a push or pull that affects an object's state of motion.
3. Normal force is always parallel to the surface.
4. There are still forces acting on an abject that is at rest.
5. Israel Newton formulated the three laws of motion.
6. As the acceleration increases, the force also increases.
7. Acceleration due to gravity is always equal to 8.9 m/s².
8. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
9. The third law of motion is also known as the law of acceleration
10. The greater the mass of an object, the greater will be its inertia.
11. The lower the temperature, the faster the sound travels.
12. As the temperature increases the speed of sound in air moves faster
13. Kinetic energy is the energy of objects in motion.
14. Kinetic energy of a moving object stays the same as the mass remains the same, but the
velocity increases.
15. Newton's third law is also called the law of interaction
16. Newton's third law acts the same objects
17. Newton's third law depends on mass and inertia
18. Interaction forces always come in pairs and they act on different objects that is why they do not
cancel each other.
19. Interaction forces do not come in pairs so they have different objects to act on.
20. Interaction forces always come in pairs but then act on the same object. </a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The fraction 645 is equivalent to 215.</p><p>This is a proper fraction once the absolute value of the top number or numerator (6) is smaller than the absolute value of the bottom number or denomintor (45).</p><p>The fraction 645 can be reduced.</p><p>We will use the Greatest Common Factor (GCF) method to simplify it.</p><p>The GCF is the largest number between which two or more numbers can be divided evenly.</p><p>To find the GCF we list the the numerator and denominator factors (*) then we find the largest number that is repeated in both lists:</p><p></p><p>* The factors of 6 are 1,2,3,6;</p><p></p><p>* The factors of 45 are 1,3,5,9,15,45.</p><p></p><p>We can see that the GCD is 3 because it is the largest number by which 6 y 45 can be divided without leaving any residue.</p><p>To reduce this fraction, simply divide the numerator and denominator by 3 (the GCF).</p><p>So, 645 = 6÷345÷3 = 215.</p><p>Thus, 645 is equivalent to 215 in the reduced form.</p><p>(*) The factors are numbers that multiply each other to get another number. For example, 2 and 3 are factors of 6, because by multiplying them you get 6.</p><p>The fraction 645 is equal to 6÷45 and can also be expressed as a decimal as 0.133333 and expressed as a percentage as 13.3333%.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>yaan lang po pa brainlest lang po</p><br />

                            27. II. TRUE OR FALSE: On the space provided for, write TRUE if the statement is correct and FALSE if it is
incorrect.
1. The net force acting on an object is directly proportional to its mass.
2. Force is a push or pull that affects an object's state of motion.
3. Normal force is always parallel to the surface.
4. There are still forces acting on an abject that is at rest.
5. Israel Newton formulated the three laws of motion.
6. As the acceleration increases, the force also increases.
7. Acceleration due to gravity is always equal to 8.9 m/s².
8. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
9. The third law of motion is also known as the law of acceleration
10. The greater the mass of an object, the greater will be its inertia.
11. The lower the temperature, the faster the sound travels.
12. As the temperature increases the speed of sound in air moves faster
13. Kinetic energy is the energy of objects in motion.
14. Kinetic energy of a moving object stays the same as the mass remains the same, but the
velocity increases.
15. Newton's third law is also called the law of interaction
16. Newton's third law acts the same objects
17. Newton's third law depends on mass and inertia
18. Interaction forces always come in pairs and they act on different objects that is why they do not
cancel each other.
19. Interaction forces do not come in pairs so they have different objects to act on.
20. Interaction forces always come in pairs but then act on the same object. </h2><br />
