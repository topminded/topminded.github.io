________________ 1. Based on the article of Laguador (2014) in International Journal of Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities, collaborative learning activities which are student-centered approach is recommended to modern pedagogy especially today that we used outcome-based education.
________________ 2. This study used the descriptive method of research utilizing an adopted questionnaire-checklist and experimental method utilizing pre-test and post-test.
________________ 3. The differences of the mean scores obtained the overall significant values of .271. Since the computed p-values are more than or exceed 0.05 level of significance, the null hypothesis states that there is no significant difference on the evaluation of teacher-respondents on the developed collaborative learning activities in English for Grade 7. In short, the results of significant values favor on the null hypothesis.
________________ 4. Additional intervention material as instructional materials in teaching English aside from the collaborative activities may be developed to further improve the performance of grammatically challenged learners.
________________ 5. To determine the level of performance of the grade 7 students as revealed in pre-test and post-test results, mean and standard deviation were applied.</a>

                                            Study Habits play a significant part in the academic life of every student. It is one of the ingredients thatcompletes to the overall success of the child in school. A good study habit in the formative years of the child couldbe carried on by the child throughout his life. That is why, the formation of the best study habit early is veryimportant to know especially among parents and teachers.Without study habit, a person may not grow and become self-limiting in life. Many areas of our life require ahabitual act of doing things. As the adage goes "Your habit becomes your destiny", a life worth living for is a productof an everyday choices that we make.According to Robinson (2000) the keys to better learning and better academic performance in schools aregood teachers, good study environment, the course of study, parents' cooperation, high quality books and, the mostimportant, the study habits. Investigating the nature of study habits is important because factors related to studyingsuch as motivation and specific study techniques have been linked to academic success.Many students fail not because they lack ability, but because they do not have adequate study skills (Menzel1982). Study habit is the tendency of a student to learn in a systematic and efficient way, when opportunity is given.It is also defined as the devotion of time and attention to acquire information or knowledge especially from booksor in other words, it's the pursuit of academic knowledge by a detailed investigation of a subject or situation (OxfordDictionary &amp; Thesaurus of English Language, 2003).Thus, in order to improve academic performance of students, it seems essential to improve their study habitswithout which desired outcomes cannot be achieved. Development of good study habits in children depends uponthe combined efforts of parents and teachers (Kizlik, 2001).Robinson (2000) found that certain bad study habits result in poor academic performance, whereas certaingood study habits result in high academic performance. Creemers and Reynold (2000), on the basis of data of theNational Assessment of Educational Progress, demonstrated a positive relationship between good study habits andacademic performance of 8th and 9th Grade students.Although there is a substantial amount of research available on the study habits and academic performancethere is no available research on this topic in Dumaran Central School. Other researchers have also pointed towardsa positive relationship between study habits and academic performance (Fatima, 1967; Siddique, 1989). Studies inPakistan have revealed the relationship of academic performance with intelligence and emotional intelligence(Shujja, 2008; Khalid &amp; Ahmad, 2009).These various studies related to the study habit and academic performance of the students lead to theformulation of this research topic. The aimed of this study is to find out the study habits of pupils in Dumaran CentralSchool and how it affects to their academic performance.Answer the following:1. What was the excerpt all about?2.

                                            SCIENTIFIC
METHOD
Observe and identify the
problem
What is the topic or project that you
want to work on?
Gather data
Use available resources (library and
internet resources, consultation with
experts, interview with key informants) to learn as
much about the problem as possible.
Form a hypothesis
This is a sort of educated guess about what you
expect. It is a statement used to predict the
outcome of an experiment.
-
Test the hypothesis
Design and perform an experiment to test your
hypothesis. An experiment has an independent
and dependent variable.
Analyze data
Record observations and analyze the
meaning of the data. Often, you'll
prepare a table or graph of the data
Draw conclusion
Conclude whether to accept or reject
your hypothesis.</a>

Also, the extent of the effect may be dampened by the level of capability of teachers to use digital learning tools and resources effectively to achieve learning outcomes. More effective use of digital teaching to raise attainment includes the ability of teachers to identify how digital tools and resources can be used to achieve learning outcomes and adapting their approach, as well as having knowledge and understanding of the technology. This applies in all schools.Where learners use digital learning at home as well as school for formal and non-formal learning activities these have positive effects on their attainment, because they have extended their learning time. This is particularly important for secondary age learners.The assessment framework, set out in Annex 2, identifies a number of educational benefits that digital learning and teaching has the potential to help learners aged 5 to 18 to realise, through the opportunity to learn in different ways, access more sources of information, and be tested and get feedback differently. In terms of raising attainment, these benefits include short term outcomes, such as having a greater feeling of control over learning and more confidence to practise a skill, through to medium term outcomes such as faster acquisition of knowledge and skills, and improved impacts in terms of learners achieving higher exam or test results where digital technology has been used.In this section, the impact of digital technology on children's attainment in a range of areas is discussed, followed by the impact on aspects of numeracy, literacy and science learning.Raising children's attainmentThere is a substantial body of research that has examined the impact of digital tools and resources on children's attainment in a range of areas.Higgins et al (2012) provide a summary of research findings from studies with experimental and quasi-experimental designs, which have been combined in meta-analyses to assess the impact of digital learning in schools. Their search identified 48 studies which synthesised empirical research of the impact of digital tools and resources on the attainment of school age learners (5-18 year olds).They found consistent but small positive associations between digital learning and educational outcomes. For example, Harrison et al (2004) identified statistically significant findings, positively associating higher levels of ICT use with school achievement at each Key Stage in England, and in English, maths, science, modern foreign languages and design technology. Somekh et al (2007) identified a link between high levels of ICT use and improved school performance. They found that the rate of improvement in tests in English at the end of primary education was faster in ICT Test Bed education authorities in England than in equivalent comparator areas. However, Higgins et al note that while these associations show, on average, schools with higher than average levels of ICT provision also have learners who perform slightly higher than average, it may be the case that high performing schools are more likely to be better equipped or more prepared to invest in technology or more motivated to bring about improvement.Higgins et al report that in general analyses of the impact of digital technology on learning, the typical overall effect size is between 0.3 and 0.4 - just slightly below the overall average for researched interventions in education (Sipe &amp; Curlette, 1997; Hattie, 2008) and no greater than other researched changes to teaching to raise attainment, such as peer tutoring or more focused feedback to learners. The range of effect sizes is also very wide (-0.03 to 1.05),which suggests that it is essential to take into account the differences between technologies and how they are used.​</a>

Since the computed p-values are more than or exceed 0.05 level ofsignificance, the null hypothesis states that there is no significant difference on theevaluation of teacher-respondents on the developed collaborative learning activitiesin English for Grade 7. In short, the results of significant values favor on the nullhypothesis.4. Additional intervention material as instructional materials inteaching English aside from the collaborative activities may be developed to furtherimprove the performance of grammatically challenged learners.5. To determine the level of performance of the grade 7 students asrevealed in pre-test and post-test results, mean and standard deviation were applied. pasagot Ng ayus​</a>

According to Panigrahi et.al. (2018) proposed that the integration of virtual communities to online learning platforms may cause a better outcome and engagement. Also, Picciano (2002) found out in his study that the success of many online course is dependent upon the nature of student to student and student to faculty interaction. Moreover, in the study of Salamat et.al. (2018) they highlighted that e-learning provides time flexibility to the students and it motivates students to do their work without the help of others. Furthermore, through their study they have found out that the students feel more comfortable when they are using the internet. Salamat et.al (2018) concluded the e-learning system in education is effective for students. Source: Herrera, M.G. (2021).

                            1. TECHNOLOGY AND LIVELIHOOD EDUCATION 7 quarter 2 learning outcome 2 perform outer packaging procedures ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1<strong>. THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS</strong></p><p>The first step in the packaging process is the manufacturing of that packaging. The manufacturing process needs to be considered when thinking about the design of the packaging. Some of the factors that will impact the manufacturing process include:</p><p></p><p>The material or substrate of the packaging</p><p>The cost of these materials</p><p>Where the packaging is going to be manufactured</p><p>The time it will take to manufacture the packaging</p><p>Whether automation or hand assembly will be utilized</p><p>When thinking about the design of the packaging, all of these factors need to be considered. They will impact not only the manufacturing process but also the overall cost of the product and your timeline.</p><p></p><p>2. <strong>THE FILLING &amp; ASSEMBLING PROCESS</strong></p><p>After the manufacturing process is completed, the packaging needs to be filled and assembled. This can take many forms depending on the nature of the product. Some of the examples include:</p><p></p><p>Is the package a simple box inside of which the product will sit?</p><p>Does the packaging require a separate tray or insert to encompass the product?</p><p>Is assembly and filling automated or manual?</p><p>These are only a few of the many points that need to be considered during the filling and assembly process. Both the product and packaging have to be protected while expediting the process.</p><p></p><p>3. <strong>THE TRANSPORTATION OF THE PRODUCT</strong></p><p>Once the packaging has been fulfilled, the product will be transported to wherever it is being sold. It is imperative for the product to be protected during this important step. Whether it is being moved by land, sea, or air, steps need to be taken to protect the integrity of the product. This needs to be incorporated into the design of the packaging.   </p><p></p><p>Consider the transportation of the product and take steps to protect it. In addition to protecting the packaging and final product, it’s important to note that packaging efficiency is also important when it comes to logistics. Well thought-out packaging means more efficiency in transportation which can reduce costs.</p><p></p><p>4. <strong>THE SHELF LIFE</strong></p><p>Shelf life is yet another area to consider when designing a packaging design. While we’re mostly familiar with shelf life in terms of perishable items, shelf life also represents how well the product will appear on the shelf. From tamper protection to fragility, these have to be considered well in advance. </p><p>A design that is too intricate and fragile might easily damage on a store shelf or on display, making it unattractive to consumers.</p><p></p><p>5. <strong>THE USER EXPERIENCE</strong></p><p>The last step in the packaging process is the experience of the user. Industry-leading brands know this and value this part of the packaging process significantly. They understand that packaging is a vehicle for communicating with the customer. In addition to protecting the product, packaging should create an experience for the consumer. It should tell a story and build the customer’s loyalty. This alone, provides a solid return on the brand’s marketing investment.</p><p></p><p>CONSIDERING THE PACKAGING CAREFULLY</p><p>In order for a brand’s packaging be successful in the marketplace, it be well thought-out and for each of the different stages of packaging development. Each stage must be considered carefully. With this goal in mind, it is crucial for every brand to enlist the help of trained professionals. At JohnsByrne, we have extensive experience in helping countless brands achieve their end goal when it comes to packaging.

                            10. Study Habits play a significant part in the academic life of every student. It is one of the ingredients thatcompletes to the overall success of the child in school. A good study habit in the formative years of the child couldbe carried on by the child throughout his life. That is why, the formation of the best study habit early is veryimportant to know especially among parents and teachers.Without study habit, a person may not grow and become self-limiting in life. Many areas of our life require ahabitual act of doing things. As the adage goes "Your habit becomes your destiny", a life worth living for is a productof an everyday choices that we make.According to Robinson (2000) the keys to better learning and better academic performance in schools aregood teachers, good study environment, the course of study, parents' cooperation, high quality books and, the mostimportant, the study habits. Investigating the nature of study habits is important because factors related to studyingsuch as motivation and specific study techniques have been linked to academic success.Many students fail not because they lack ability, but because they do not have adequate study skills (Menzel1982). Study habit is the tendency of a student to learn in a systematic and efficient way, when opportunity is given.It is also defined as the devotion of time and attention to acquire information or knowledge especially from booksor in other words, it's the pursuit of academic knowledge by a detailed investigation of a subject or situation (OxfordDictionary &amp; Thesaurus of English Language, 2003).Thus, in order to improve academic performance of students, it seems essential to improve their study habitswithout which desired outcomes cannot be achieved. Development of good study habits in children depends uponthe combined efforts of parents and teachers (Kizlik, 2001).Robinson (2000) found that certain bad study habits result in poor academic performance, whereas certaingood study habits result in high academic performance. Creemers and Reynold (2000), on the basis of data of theNational Assessment of Educational Progress, demonstrated a positive relationship between good study habits andacademic performance of 8th and 9th Grade students.Although there is a substantial amount of research available on the study habits and academic performancethere is no available research on this topic in Dumaran Central School. Other researchers have also pointed towardsa positive relationship between study habits and academic performance (Fatima, 1967; Siddique, 1989). Studies inPakistan have revealed the relationship of academic performance with intelligence and emotional intelligence(Shujja, 2008; Khalid &amp; Ahmad, 2009).These various studies related to the study habit and academic performance of the students lead to theformulation of this research topic. The aimed of this study is to find out the study habits of pupils in Dumaran CentralSchool and how it affects to their academic performance.Answer the following:1. What was the excerpt all about?2.

METHOD
Observe and identify the
problem
What is the topic or project that you
want to work on?
Gather data
Use available resources (library and
internet resources, consultation with
experts, interview with key informants) to learn as
much about the problem as possible.
Form a hypothesis
This is a sort of educated guess about what you
expect. It is a statement used to predict the
outcome of an experiment.
-
Test the hypothesis
Design and perform an experiment to test your
hypothesis. An experiment has an independent
and dependent variable.
Analyze data
Record observations and analyze the
meaning of the data. Often, you'll
prepare a table or graph of the data
Draw conclusion
Conclude whether to accept or reject
your hypothesis.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>You have probably learned that the scientific method is a series of steps that help to investigate. To answer those questions, scientists use data and evidence gathered from observations, experience, or experiments to answer their questions.But scientific inquiry rarely proceeds in the same sequence of steps outlined by the scientific method. For example, the order of the steps might change because more questions arise from the data that is collected. Still, to come to verifiable conclusions, logical, repeatable steps of the scientific method must be followed. This video of The Scientific Method Made Easy explains scientific method succinctly and well.</p><br />

Also, the extent of the effect may be dampened by the level of capability of teachers to use digital learning tools and resources effectively to achieve learning outcomes. More effective use of digital teaching to raise attainment includes the ability of teachers to identify how digital tools and resources can be used to achieve learning outcomes and adapting their approach, as well as having knowledge and understanding of the technology. This applies in all schools.Where learners use digital learning at home as well as school for formal and non-formal learning activities these have positive effects on their attainment, because they have extended their learning time. This is particularly important for secondary age learners.The assessment framework, set out in Annex 2, identifies a number of educational benefits that digital learning and teaching has the potential to help learners aged 5 to 18 to realise, through the opportunity to learn in different ways, access more sources of information, and be tested and get feedback differently. In terms of raising attainment, these benefits include short term outcomes, such as having a greater feeling of control over learning and more confidence to practise a skill, through to medium term outcomes such as faster acquisition of knowledge and skills, and improved impacts in terms of learners achieving higher exam or test results where digital technology has been used.In this section, the impact of digital technology on children's attainment in a range of areas is discussed, followed by the impact on aspects of numeracy, literacy and science learning.Raising children's attainmentThere is a substantial body of research that has examined the impact of digital tools and resources on children's attainment in a range of areas.Higgins et al (2012) provide a summary of research findings from studies with experimental and quasi-experimental designs, which have been combined in meta-analyses to assess the impact of digital learning in schools. Their search identified 48 studies which synthesised empirical research of the impact of digital tools and resources on the attainment of school age learners (5-18 year olds).They found consistent but small positive associations between digital learning and educational outcomes. For example, Harrison et al (2004) identified statistically significant findings, positively associating higher levels of ICT use with school achievement at each Key Stage in England, and in English, maths, science, modern foreign languages and design technology. Somekh et al (2007) identified a link between high levels of ICT use and improved school performance. They found that the rate of improvement in tests in English at the end of primary education was faster in ICT Test Bed education authorities in England than in equivalent comparator areas. However, Higgins et al note that while these associations show, on average, schools with higher than average levels of ICT provision also have learners who perform slightly higher than average, it may be the case that high performing schools are more likely to be better equipped or more prepared to invest in technology or more motivated to bring about improvement.Higgins et al report that in general analyses of the impact of digital technology on learning, the typical overall effect size is between 0.3 and 0.4 - just slightly below the overall average for researched interventions in education (Sipe &amp; Curlette, 1997; Hattie, 2008) and no greater than other researched changes to teaching to raise attainment, such as peer tutoring or more focused feedback to learners. The range of effect sizes is also very wide (-0.03 to 1.05),which suggests that it is essential to take into account the differences between technologies and how they are used.​</h2><br />

How does the Constructivist Theory support the MTB- MLE approach, and how does it differ from traditional teaching methods?2. Discuss the challenges and opportunities of implementing a Constructivist approach in MTB-MLE. What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of adopting a Constructivist approach, and how might these vary depending on the specific context and community in which MTB-MLE is being taught?3. What is the significance of knowing the mother tongue in education? How does the use of the mother tongue impact the academic performance and overall development of learners?

How can teachers effectively incorporate local culture into their teaching practice to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes? Discuss the potential benefits and challenges of incorporating local culture into education.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.The Constructivist Theory and traditional teaching approaches differ significantly in the context of teaching MTB-MLE. Traditional teaching methods emphasize the teacher as the primary source of knowledge and use a standardized curriculum, while Constructivist Theory emphasizes active learning and student-centered approaches. In MTB-MLE, Constructivist Theory supports the use of local languages as a medium of instruction, which enables students to connect their learning to their own culture and experiences. Traditional teaching methods, on the other hand, may not be as effective in supporting students' language development and cultural identity.</p><p></p><p>2.Implementing a Constructivist approach in MTB-MLE can be challenging because it requires a significant shift in teaching practices and the creation of culturally relevant materials. However, it can also provide opportunities for students to engage in active learning and develop critical thinking skills. The potential benefits of adopting a Constructivist approach include improved language development, increased engagement and motivation, and better academic performance. However, there may be drawbacks, such as the need for more resources and training for teachers. The effectiveness of a Constructivist approach in MTB-MLE may also depend on the specific context and community in which it is being taught.</p><p></p><p>3.Knowing the mother tongue is significant in education because it enables learners to connect their learning to their own culture and experiences. Using the mother tongue as a medium of instruction can also improve learners' language development and overall academic performance. Additionally, using the mother tongue can help preserve and promote local languages and cultures. However, the disadvantages of using the mother tongue include limited access to learning materials and limited opportunities for students to learn additional languages that may be necessary for future academic and professional endeavors.</p><p></p><p>4.Understanding the local culture is important in education because it allows teachers to create culturally relevant materials and practices that engage students and promote learning. Incorporating local culture into teaching practices can also promote cultural diversity and respect. Effective incorporation of local culture involves engaging with the community, identifying local resources and practices, and creating learning materials that reflect students' experiences and cultural backgrounds. The potential benefits of incorporating local culture into education include increased student engagement and motivation, improved academic performance, and the promotion of cultural diversity. However, challenges may include limited resources and the need for cultural sensitivity and understanding</p><br />
