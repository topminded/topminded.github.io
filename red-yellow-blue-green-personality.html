                                            What is Sableye Pokèmon? Sableye is a bipedal Pokémon with a dark purple body, armed with sharp teeth and claws, which it uses to dig through soil. It has pale blue, gemstone-like eyes, which allow it to see in low light and sparkle in the dark. It also has a red gemstone on its chest, and its back has a blue and green gemstone as well as another red one. These gem-like eyes and adornments on its body are caused by its diet, which consists of rocks and raw gemstones. It also targets Carbink as prey, though they are usually taken by Gabite before Sableye can reach them. It is feared by people since it is said to steal a person's soul if they look into its eyes. It is nocturnal and is rarely seen. It lives in caves.As Mega Sableye, all the energy from its Mega Evolution is concentrated into the red jewel on its chest, causing it to rip out of Sableye's skin and significantly increase in size; the detached jewel leaves a small hole in Mega Sableye's chest. Its ears elongate, and it gains a spike on the top of its head. Its teeth turn from white to yellow, and its eyes also change from pale blue to a crimson red, with diagonal slits at their inner edges. Its back gains more gems: a second green one, a second red one, and two small yellow gems. The enlarged jewel is said to boast such incredible hardness that no attack can even leave a scratch on it. During battle, Mega Sableye shelters itself behind the jewel, from where it can take advantage of any openings its target leaves exposed.[1] However, being forced to support its massive jewel leaves Sableye unable to turn quickly, making it vulnerable from behind.​</a>

                            11. What is Sableye Pokèmon? Sableye is a bipedal Pokémon with a dark purple body, armed with sharp teeth and claws, which it uses to dig through soil. It has pale blue, gemstone-like eyes, which allow it to see in low light and sparkle in the dark. It also has a red gemstone on its chest, and its back has a blue and green gemstone as well as another red one. These gem-like eyes and adornments on its body are caused by its diet, which consists of rocks and raw gemstones. It also targets Carbink as prey, though they are usually taken by Gabite before Sableye can reach them. It is feared by people since it is said to steal a person's soul if they look into its eyes. It is nocturnal and is rarely seen. It lives in caves.As Mega Sableye, all the energy from its Mega Evolution is concentrated into the red jewel on its chest, causing it to rip out of Sableye's skin and significantly increase in size; the detached jewel leaves a small hole in Mega Sableye's chest. Its ears elongate, and it gains a spike on the top of its head. Its teeth turn from white to yellow, and its eyes also change from pale blue to a crimson red, with diagonal slits at their inner edges. Its back gains more gems: a second green one, a second red one, and two small yellow gems. The enlarged jewel is said to boast such incredible hardness that no attack can even leave a scratch on it. During battle, Mega Sableye shelters itself behind the jewel, from where it can take advantage of any openings its target leaves exposed.[1] However, being forced to support its massive jewel leaves Sableye unable to turn quickly, making it vulnerable from behind.​</h2><br />

Its teeth turn from white to yellow, and its eyes also change from pale blue to a crimson red, with diagonal slits at their inner edges. Its back gains more gems: a second green one, a second red one, and two small yellow gems. The enlarged jewel is said to boast such incredible hardness that no attack can even leave a scratch on it. During battle, Mega Sableye shelters itself behind the jewel, from where it can take advantage of any openings its target leaves exposed.[1] However, being forced to support its massive jewel leaves Sableye unable to turn quickly, making it vulnerable from behind.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>ty for the pnts </p><br />

one of each color? (with solution pls)</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The blindfolded person must get at least 4 balls to be certain of getting at least one of each color.</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>The worst-case scenario is if the blindfolded person picks balls of only one color, say red. After getting 3 red balls, the next ball must be of a different color, since there are only 5 balls of each color. Therefore, on the fourth pick, the person is certain to get a ball of a different color, ensuring that there is at least one ball of each color.</p><br />
