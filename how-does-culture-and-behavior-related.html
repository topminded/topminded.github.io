Inequality between the genders is a phenomenon that goes back at least 4,000 years (Lerner 1986). Although the forms and ways in which it has been practiced differ between cultures and change significantly through history, its persistence has led to the formulation of the concept of patriarchy. Patriarchy refers to a set of institutional structures (like property rights, access to positions of power, relationship to sources of income) that are based on the belief that men and women are dichotomous and unequal categories. Key to patriarchy is what might be called the dominant gender ideology toward sexual differences: the assumption that physiological sex differences between males and females are related to differences in their character, behavior, and ability (i.e., their gender). These differences are used to justify a gendered division of social roles and inequality in access to rewards, positions of power, and privilege. The question that feminists ask therefore is: How does this distinction between male and female, and the attribution of different qualities to each, serve to organize our institutions (e.g., the family, law, the occupational structure, religious institutions, the division between public and private) and to perpetuate inequality between the sexes?

Paraphrased Text
Patriarchy is defined as institutional structures (like property rights, access to positions of power, relationship to sources of income) that are based on the belief that men and women are unequal. The basic assumption of patriarchy is that physiological sex differences between males and females are related to differences in their character, behavior, and ability. But, how does the distinction between male and female serve to organize our institutions and to perpetuate inequality between the sexes?</a>

                                            Directions: Read and reflect on the short essay then answer the guide questions on a separate sheet of paper.          Man as a Social Animal        By Ma. Teresa B. Berondo   "Man is by nature a social animal." This is a famous line by Aristotle, a well-known ancient philosopher. What does it mean? Do we take its meaning literally? Or does it have a deeper meaning beyond the actual words? Since the human being is considered the highest form of animal, it can literally mean that man by nature is armored with mechanisms like language and reason that he uses to interact with others. In a deeper sense, human beings cannot exist in this world alone. People want the company of others to feel the love and care that they need. This feeling of closeness can be found in our own family, close friends, and personal relationships. Also, people form a social group with common interest and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background and other personal qualities. As human beings form social www.shsph.blogspot.com groups, they create social relation with others that are mutually beneficial to each other. This makes them engage in common aspirations and support each other's beliefs. As man gets together and interacts with one another based on relationships, common identity, and culture, man is indeed a social animal. Think About This! 1. Do you believe that man is a social animal? Why or why not? 2. How does man becomes a social animal based on the essay? 3. How important is human interaction in building the nation?​</a>

Inequality between the genders is a phenomenon that goes back at least 4,000 years (Lerner 1986). Although the forms and ways in which it has been practiced differ between cultures and change significantly through history, its persistence has led to the formulation of the concept of patriarchy. Patriarchy refers to a set of institutional structures (like property rights, access to positions of power, relationship to sources of income) that are based on the belief that men and women are dichotomous and unequal categories. Key to patriarchy is what might be called the dominant gender ideology toward sexual differences: the assumption that physiological sex differences between males and females are related to differences in their character, behavior, and ability (i.e., their gender). These differences are used to justify a gendered division of social roles and inequality in access to rewards, positions of power, and privilege. The question that feminists ask therefore is: How does this distinction between male and female, and the attribution of different qualities to each, serve to organize our institutions (e.g., the family, law, the occupational structure, religious institutions, the division between public and private) and to perpetuate inequality between the sexes?

Patriarchy is defined as institutional structures (like property rights, access to positions of power, relationship to sources of income) that are based on the belief that men and women are unequal. The basic assumption of patriarchy is that physiological sex differences between males and females are related to differences in their character, behavior, and ability. But, how does the distinction between male and female serve to organize our institutions and to perpetuate inequality between the sexes?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>answer</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>The phrased text is good because it provides a clear and concise definition of patriarchy and explains how it perpetuates gender inequality. It acknowledges that gender inequality has existed for thousands of years and has taken different forms across cultures and history. By highlighting the link between the belief in physiological sex differences and the perpetuation of inequality in access to rewards, positions of power, and privilege, the text provides a framework for understanding the root causes of gender inequality. Furthermore, the question posed at the end of the text reflects a critical feminist perspective on the issue and invites readers to consider how gendered distinctions are embedded in various institutions and practices in society. Overall, the text presents a well-reasoned argument and provides important insights into the persistence of gender inequality.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>3. How do male and female characters relate to one another? Are these relationships sources of conflict? Are these conflicts resolved?</strong></p><p>In many ways, male and female characters are quite similar to one another. They both experience the same emotions and often have the same goals. However, their relationships can be sources of conflict. This is because men and women often have different ways of approaching problems and different ways of communicating. These differences can lead to misunderstandings and conflict. However, these conflicts can often be resolved through effective communication and by understanding the other person's perspective.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>9. How does the marital status of a character affect her er decisions or happiness?</strong></p><p>A character’s marital status can be a significant factor in their happiness. Whether a character is married or not can affect their decisions, their contentment, and their overall satisfaction with life.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>10. How does culture view women vs. men?</strong></p><p>Culture has a major impact on how women and men are viewed. In many cultures, women are seen as inferior to men. They are not given the same opportunities and are often not treated with the same respect. This can be a major problem for women who want to succeed in life. In some cultures, women are not even allowed to work or own property. They are seen as property of their husbands or fathers and are not given the same rights as men. This can make it very difficult for women to get ahead in life. In other cultures, women are seen as equals to men. They are given the same opportunities and are treated with the same respect. This can help women to succeed in life and be more respected in society.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>12. What are the power relationships between men and women (or characters assuming male/female roles)?</strong></p><p>In many societies, men have more power than women. This is because men are often seen as being more physically strong and capable than women. They are also often seen as being more logical and rational, which can give them an advantage in decision-making.</p><p>The power relationships between men and women can also vary depending on the specific situation. For example, in some workplaces, women may have more power than men. In other situations, such as in the home, men may have more power than women.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>13. Do characters take on traits from opposite genders? How so? How does this change others' reactions to them?</strong></p><p>It's generally accepted that people do tend to adopt some qualities from the opposite gender, whether it's due to nature or nurture. For example, a man might be more emotional and sensitive than average, while a woman might be more assertive and analytical.</p><p>These traits don't necessarily make someone feel like they're in the wrong body, but they can cause confusion and conflict in relationships. For instance, a man who cries easily might be seen as weak by his male friends, while a woman who's very assertive might be viewed as bossy by her female friends. In some cases, people might be drawn to others who have qualities they lack, which can lead to a more balanced and fulfilling relationship.</p><br />

Berondo   "Man is by nature a social animal." This is a famous line by Aristotle, a well-known ancient philosopher. What does it mean? Do we take its meaning literally? Or does it have a deeper meaning beyond the actual words? Since the human being is considered the highest form of animal, it can literally mean that man by nature is armored with mechanisms like language and reason that he uses to interact with others. In a deeper sense, human beings cannot exist in this world alone. People want the company of others to feel the love and care that they need. This feeling of closeness can be found in our own family, close friends, and personal relationships. Also, people form a social group with common interest and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background and other personal qualities. As human beings form social www.shsph.blogspot.com groups, they create social relation with others that are mutually beneficial to each other. This makes them engage in common aspirations and support each other's beliefs. As man gets together and interacts with one another based on relationships, common identity, and culture, man is indeed a social animal. Think About This! 1. Do you believe that man is a social animal? Why or why not? 2. How does man becomes a social animal based on the essay? 3. How important is human interaction in building the nation?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. Yes, I believe that man is a social animal because humans have a natural instinct to live in society with other human beings.</p><p></p><p>2. Man becomes a social animal by forming social groups with common interests and similar perspectives in life despite their differences in terms of personality, behavior, family background, and other personal qualities.</p><p></p><p>3. Human interaction is very important in building a nation because it helps people form social groups that can work together towards common goals.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1. How are</strong><strong> women's lives portrayed in the work?</strong></p><p>In "Dead Stars," women's lives are portrayed primarily in domestic roles and as objects of men's affections. The story depicts women as taking care of children and managing household tasks, while men are depicted in more professional roles.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. Is the</strong><strong> form and content of the work influenced by the writer's gender?</strong></p><p>This is not specified in the critique but one can approach it as that as a woman writer Paz Marquez Benitez could have chosen to represent the women characters differently.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. How do</strong><strong> male and female characters relate to one another? Are these relationships sources of conflict? Are these conflicts resolved?</strong></p><p>In "Dead Stars," the male characters often relate to the female characters in a patriarchal and possessive manner. The central relationship in the story, between Alfredo and Julia, is a source of conflict and ultimately unresolved. Alfredo's continuing affection for Julia creates distance in his marriage and prevents him from fully committing to his wife.</p><p></p><p><strong>4. Does the</strong><strong> work challenge or affirm traditional views of women?</strong></p><p>The critique suggests that "Dead Stars" reinforces traditional views of women as being relegated to domestic roles and as objects of men's affections.</p><p></p><p><strong>5. How do the</strong><strong> images of women in the story reflect patriarchal social forces that have impeded women's efforts to achieve full equality with men?</strong></p><p>The images of women in the story, who are primarily depicted in domestic roles and as objects of men's affections, reflect patriarchal social forces that have limited women's opportunities and autonomy.</p><p></p><p><strong>6. What</strong><strong> marital expectations are imposed on the characters? What effect do these expectations have?</strong></p><p>The characters are expected to conform to traditional gender roles within their marriage, with men as the head of the household and women as subservient. These expectations create distance and dissatisfaction in the marriage between Alfredo and Esperanza.</p><p></p><p><strong>7. What</strong><strong> behavioral expectations are imposed on the characters? What effect do these expectations have?</strong></p><p>Characters are expected to conform to traditional gender norms in terms of their behavior and emotions. Alfredo's emotions and behavior are constrained by societal expectations that men should not show vulnerability or be emotionally attached to women other than their wives.</p><p></p><p><strong>8. If a female</strong><strong> character were male, how would the story be different (and vice versa)?</strong></p><p>If Julia were a male character, the story would likely focus on a different kind of power imbalance, as a man in a relationship with a woman would not be constrained by the same societal expectations. It's possible that the story would have a different outcome as well, with the relationship between Julia and Esperanza being more of a rivalry.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Inequality between the genders is a phenomenon that goes back at least 4,000 years (Lerner 1986). Although the forms and ways in which it has been practiced differ between cultures and change significantly through history, its persistence has led to the formulation of the concept of patriarchy. Patriarchy refers to a set of institutional structures (like property rights, access to positions of power, relationship to sources of income) that are based on the belief that men and women are dichotomous and unequal categories. Key to patriarchy is what might be called the dominant gender ideology toward sexual differences: the assumption that physiological sex differences between males and females are related to differences in their character, behavior, and ability (i.e., their gender). These differences are used to justify a gendered division of social roles and inequality in access to rewards, positions of power, and privilege. The question that feminists ask therefore is: How does this distinction between male and female, and the attribution of different qualities to each, serve to organize our institutions (e.g., the family, law, the occupational structure, religious institutions, the division between public and private) and to perpetuate inequality between the sexes?

                        <p>The original text discusses the idea of patriarchy, which is a set of institutional structures based on the belief that men and women are inequalities, and the persistence of gender inequality for at least 4,000 years. To justify a gendered division of social roles and inequality in access to rewards, positions of power, and privilege, the dominant gender ideology regarding physiological sex differences is utilized. Feminists pose the question of how this distinction between men and women perpetuates gender inequality.</p><p></p><p>The main points of the original text are accurately conveyed in the paraphrased version. It explains what patriarchy means and how it is based on the idea that there is gender inequality. Gendered social roles and unequal access to rewards, power, and privilege are defended by the assumption that physiological sex differences result in character, behavior, and ability differences. Finally, it raises the issue of how gender inequality in various institutions is perpetuated, which is a concern for feminists.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the paraphrased text is not necessarily beneficial or detrimental; rather, it serves as a neutral summary of the primary ideas in the original text.
