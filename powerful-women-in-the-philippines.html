                    <p>Although the Philippines appears to be ahead of its neighboring countries by having two women
presidents already, major hurdles are still in place for women to gain a firmer foothold in
politics. It is still basically an elite-male dominated political landscape. While there is a
perceptible increase in the number of women elected into government posts, assumption to
institutional leadership does not necessarily translate into the expected degree of political clout.
The question of resources also affects women&#039;s access to decision-making positions since
women and men do not enjoy the same access to resources that yields power. The lack of
economic power, similarly, deprives women of their rights and opportunities.

                                            empowerment Analysis of these figures in relation to previous global gender gap reports may lead to the conclusion that the gap will finally close in a span of 82 years (World EconomicForum, 2016)The Philippines elected not one, but two women presidents in a span of less than 20 years. The first was Corazon "Cory" Cojuangco Aquino, who was installed in 1986 following the snap electionsorchestrated by the dictator Ferdinand Marcos, Sr. From 1998 to 2013, the Philippines showed acontinuous increase of elected officials from 16.15% in 1998 to 19.92% in 2013. Considered a good indicator of increasing women politicalparticipation in the country, two out of the five presidential candidates in the 2016 elections were womenAt the grassroots, women's organizations and NGOs mainstreamed gender issues in community organizing to ensure active participation of in local government units and communities Community-based NGOs and peoples' organizations played significant roles that enabled empowerment for women in thecommunities and articulate their interests in various levels of decision making.However, the dominant patriarchal framework of politics and governance has made it hard for women to assert themselves in traditional centersof power like states, courts of law, congresses, and even local governments. While Left organizations have turned their attention to women's issues and recognized the equal importance of the reproductive and productivespheres, women's issues - especially those dealing with sexuality - are still marginalized in the discourse on social transformation. Divorce and abortion are issues that remain to be absent in the debates among other social movements.The Filipino women's movement has come a long way, but still has miles to go,so to speak.Evidence 1Evidence 2 Reason #2 Evidence 1Evidence 2Reason #3Evidence 1Conflict: Evidence 1,2 &amp;3 Conclusion:Pa tulong naman po pleaseee thank you po​</a>

                            1. Although the Philippines appears to be ahead of its neighboring countries by having two women
presidents already, major hurdles are still in place for women to gain a firmer foothold in
politics. It is still basically an elite-male dominated political landscape. While there is a
perceptible increase in the number of women elected into government posts, assumption to
institutional leadership does not necessarily translate into the expected degree of political clout.
The question of resources also affects women's access to decision-making positions since
women and men do not enjoy the same access to resources that yields power. The lack of
economic power, similarly, deprives women of their rights and opportunities.

Philippine Politics and Society: A Situationer.
3. Questions:
a. Identify and narrate at least one instance in the past
when women were relegated in Philippine political
life.
b. The author said, "Women and men do not enjoy the
same access to resources that yields power." While
this is true today, identify and narrate at least one
instance in the past when women yielded power in
Philippine society.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>a. In the past, women in the Philippines were relegated in Philippine political life due to the fact that they were often excluded from decision-making roles, or those which could bring them political power. This was a result of oppressive gender roles that governed the patriarchal society, where men wielded the majority of the power. For example, women were not allowed to vote until after the Second World War and until the Philippine Constitution of 1987. </p><p></p><p>b. One instance in the past when women yielded power in Philippine society was during the reign of Joséphine de Beauharnais, who was the first female Governor-General of the Philippines. She was an intelligent and influential leader who made significant strides for women's rights during her political period in the 1800s. She championed women's educational efforts, repeal of oppressive policies that suppresses women's economic opportunities, and provided greater access to political rights for women. She made a bold statement for the era by being the first female leader in the region.</p><br />

The first was Corazon "Cory" Cojuangco Aquino, who was installed in 1986 following the snap electionsorchestrated by the dictator Ferdinand Marcos, Sr. From 1998 to 2013, the Philippines showed acontinuous increase of elected officials from 16.15% in 1998 to 19.92% in 2013. Considered a good indicator of increasing women politicalparticipation in the country, two out of the five presidential candidates in the 2016 elections were womenAt the grassroots, women's organizations and NGOs mainstreamed gender issues in community organizing to ensure active participation of in local government units and communities Community-based NGOs and peoples' organizations played significant roles that enabled empowerment for women in thecommunities and articulate their interests in various levels of decision making.However, the dominant patriarchal framework of politics and governance has made it hard for women to assert themselves in traditional centersof power like states, courts of law, congresses, and even local governments. While Left organizations have turned their attention to women's issues and recognized the equal importance of the reproductive and productivespheres, women's issues - especially those dealing with sexuality - are still marginalized in the discourse on social transformation. Divorce and abortion are issues that remain to be absent in the debates among other social movements.The Filipino women's movement has come a long way, but still has miles to go,so to speak.Evidence 1Evidence 2 Reason #2 Evidence 1Evidence 2Reason #3Evidence 1Conflict: Evidence 1,2 &amp;3 Conclusion:Pa tulong naman po pleaseee thank you po​</h2><br />
