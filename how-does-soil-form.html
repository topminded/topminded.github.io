                        SOIL<p></p>Loam soil<p></p><p>Is a type of soil, specifically a soil composed of a pulverized mixture of varying proportions of silt, sand and moistened clay. </p><p></p><p>This is often said to be the best type of soil for cultivating plants because it has the capability of holding enough water for the nourishment of the plant and due to the existence of humus, <strong>a brown or black complex variable material resulting from complete decomposition of plant or animal matter due to small and microscopic organisms that eats and then defecates it</strong>, to form the organic portion of soil than is usually found in loam.</p><p></p><p><strong>HUMUS</strong></p><p></p><p>The humus commonly consists of about 60% carbon, 6% nitrogen, and smaller amounts of phosphorus and sulfur that is good for the plants's growth. Because, it helps determine soil fertility level and humus also provides further essential benefits to the soil. </p><p></p><p></p>Sand soil<p></p><p>A type of soil containing 10 percent of clay and roughly 85 percent lax granular material that results from the disintegration of rock matters, composed of particles smaller than gravel but larger than silt.</p><p></p>Clay soil<p></p><p>A soil composed of an earthy matter that resembles mud and becomes plastic when moist but hard when fired, that consists mainly of purified particles of hydrous aluminum silicates and other minerals, and that is particularly used for making brick, tile, and pottery because it has the ability to be molded.</p><p></p>Why is soil an important part of the environment?<p></p><p>Because the soil makes up the majority of the Earth's surface, it is essential for vegetations to prosper and grow, and animals and humans depends on plants, trees and other foods that grows here.</p><p></p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><p>#BrainlyOnlineEducation</p><p>#LearnAtBrainly</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1.Soil is a material composed of five ingredients — minerals, soil organic matter, living organisms, gas, and water. Soil minerals are divided into three size classes — clay, silt, and sand (Figure 1); the percentages of particles in these size classes is called soil texture.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>2.</strong></p><p><strong>2.Soil minerals form the basis of soil. They are produced from rocks (parent material) through the processes of weathering and natural erosion. Water, wind, temperature change, gravity, chemical interaction, living organisms and pressure differences all help break down parent material</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>3.Water, wind, temperature change, gravity, chemical interaction, living organisms and pressure differences all help break down parent material. The types of parent materials and the conditions under which they break down will influence the properties of the soil formed.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Weathering causes the disintegration of rock near the surface of the earth. Plant and animal life, atmosphere and water are the major causes of weathering. Weathering breaks down and loosens the surface minerals of rock so they can be transported away by agents of erosion such as water, wind and ice.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>What are the component of the soil? <p></p><p>Soil Composition</p><p>The basic components of soil are minerals, organic matter, water and air. The typical soil consists of approximately 45% mineral, 5% organic matter, 20-30% water, and 20-30% air. </p><p></p>How do rocks turn into soil? <p>Answer and Explanation: Rocks turn into soil through the process of weathering. Weathering is when rocks are broken down into smaller pieces. Physical weathering occurs when natural forces, such as water or wind, physically break apart the rock without chemically changing it.</p><p></p>What factor determine the kind of soil formed? <p>Soils are formed through the interaction of five major factors: time, climate, parent material, topography and relief, and organisms. The relative influence of each factor varies from place to place, but the combination of all five factors normally determines the kind of soil developing in any given place.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p>Sana makatulong pa brainlies answer naman po<p></p><p></p>Thank u<p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. There is an important link between soils and water, the quality of our water being closely linked to the quality of the soils. Water in the soil supplies plants and animals, but acts also to transport nutrients and other important substances from the soil to plants, microbes etc.</p><p>2. When water is added to soil, it can replace the oxygen that is naturally in the soil, and make the soil darker. This means wetter soil will have less oxygen compared with drier soil. When enough water is added, soil can become saturated and the water will start to form a layer on top of it.</p><p>3. Yes, because when the soil interact with a water or some liquid material it will certainly deform by the energy absorbed or lost.</p><p>4. Laying pebbles over soil makes sure the soil doesn't get eroded by rain or damaged from over-exposure to sunlight. This makes sure your plants live longer and don't get damaged by unideal conditions. Some gardening pebbles also allow you to walk on them.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope this helps.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Soil</strong> is a material made of minerals, soil organic matter, living organisms, gas, and water. Soil minerals are grouped into clay, silt, and sand. Soil texture is the percentage of particles in these size classes. The mineralogy of soils is assorted. Soil organic matter in various states of decomposition indicates soil quality.

                            25. Questions 1. Why should nitrogen in the atmosphere be converted to other forms? 2. If animal urine contains nitrogenous waste such as ammonia (NH, NH4), how does it become a part of the cycle again? 3. Based on the diagram, how does diatomic nitrogen in the atmosphere goes to soil? 4. What is the role of plants in the nitrogen cycle? 5. How do animals acquire nitrogen?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.To be used by plants, the N2 must be transformed through a process called nitrogen fixation. Fixation converts nitrogen in the atmosphere into forms that plants can absorb through their root systems. ... The fixed nitrogen is then carried to other parts of the plant and is used to form plant tissues, so the plant can grow.</p><p>2.</p><p>3.Although nitrogen is very abundant in the atmosphere as dinitrogen gas (N2), it is largely inaccessible in this form to most organisms, making nitrogen a scarce resource and often limiting primary productivity in many ecosystems. Only when nitrogen is converted from dinitrogen gas into ammonia (NH3) does it become available to primary producers, such as plants.</p><p>4.Nitrogen moves from organic materials, such as manure or plant materials to an inorganic form of nitrogen that plants can use. Eventually, the plant's nutrients are used up and the plant dies and decomposes. This becomes important in the second stage of the nitrogen cycle.</p><p>5.Animals get the nitrogen they need by eating plants or other animals that contain nitrogen. When organisms die, their bodies decompose bringing the nitrogen into soil on land or into ocean water. Bacteria alter the nitrogen into a form that plants are able to use.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sorry po diko po alam sagot sa number 2 eh</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Soil is formed through the process of rock weathering. Weathering is the breakdown of rocks into smaller particles when in contact with water (flowing through rocks), air or living organisms. Weathering can occur physically, biologically or chemically.<br />
