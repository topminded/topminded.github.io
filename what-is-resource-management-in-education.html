                            12. The study was conducted in the secondary schools in Nigeria. To guide the investigation the researcher raised research question and formulated onehypothesis in the study. A sample of fifty-six schools was selected from a total population of 278 schools in the Delta North Senatorial District through the stratified random technique. In these fifty-six schools, there was a total of 5,315 staff from which respondents were drawn. Twenty per cent of the targetpopulation was the subject of the study.A questionnaire was used in collecting data which were analyzed using percentage and Z-test statistic.
