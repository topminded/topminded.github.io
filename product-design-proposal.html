You are a member of the design department of RER packaging company . Your company is tapped to create the best packaging box that will contain 2 identical cylindrical containers with the box's volume set at 100 cubic inches. The box has an open top. The cover will just be design in the reference to the box's dimension . You are to present the design proposal for the box and cylinder to the chief executive officer of the dairy company and head of the RER packaging department. The design proposal is evaluated according to the following : explanation of the proposal, accuracy of computations, utilizations of the resources ,and appropriateness of the models. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>So we have a box holding 2 identical cylinders. The box doesn't have a lid.</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>We ignore the thickness of the walls of the cylinders and the box.
</p><p>
</p><p>:
</p><p>
</p><p>Let's split the box into 2 squares, each with a volume of 50 cu in.
</p><p>
</p><p>Write an expression for volume:
</p><p>
</p><p>V = x^3 Substitute:
</p><p>
</p><p>50 = x^3
</p><p>
</p><p>x = cuberoot50 = 3.684 This is the length of each of the sides of the square box, which in this case happens to be a cube. It is also the diameter and the height of our cylinders.
</p><p>
</p><p>Let's get our data together:
</p><p>
</p><p>The box is rectangular, it measures:
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>width: 3.684
</p><p>
</p><p>length: 2(3.684) = 7.368
</p><p>
</p><p>height: 3.684
</p><p>
</p><p>Volume: 100 cu inches
</p><p>
</p><p>The cylinders:
</p><p>
</p><p>Diameter: 3.684 each
</p><p>
</p><p>Height: 3.684
</p><p>
</p><p>Volume: Pi*r^2*height = Pi*(3.684/2)*3.684 = 21.32 cu in each cylinder

</p><p>note 1: this is a math forum. There are parts to your problem that do not deal with math, so you better get crackin'
