Fill in the blanks with the word/s that will make the statement correct. Communication came from the ________ word “Communicare” which means to share or to ___________. It is also believed that communication is a certain _________ for it follows a sequence or flow. One of its components is _________ who happens to be the source of information. On the other hand, there is the Message which serves as the thought or idea being sent. The Receiver or also known as the __________ receives the message and answers or response with a____________. Communication has been studied by several proponents already. They have developed different models of it. The Models of Communication is defined as the __________ representations of the proposed element included in the communication process. Some of the models are Lasswell’s Model which was developed by ____________. There is also the Shannon and _________ Model. One of the simplest and easiest model to study is the Schramm’s Model. This model can be viewed with cyclical process and it was developed by ___________. However in David Berlo’s model, he emphasized on the importance of the connection of the encoder and the decoder. This model is called __________________. Last model that you have encountered is proposed by Dean C. Barnlund, It is called as the Barnlund’s Model of communication. This has been different from others because it addressed the ________ type of communication process by developing his ______________ communication process. He also stated that the communication process is _________ and _________ process.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:The communication model is a simple description of the communication process that relates one communication component to another.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The communication model is made to make it easier to understand the communication process and see the basic components that need to be in a communication. Communication is also a process. This can be seen from every symptom or event that does not escape the existence of a communication that exists between humans.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Conceptually, there are 3 communication models:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>    linear model</strong></p><p><strong>    interactional model</strong></p><p><strong>    transactional model.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The communication model that I am trying to develop is a communication model in the education sector. So far, teaching and learning activities in the classroom usually use a linear model (passive students) or interactional models (active students). I will try to combine the two communication models into a new model where the role of the teacher (sender of information) is an active and dominant role while the role of students (recipient of information) is passive but has the flexibility to be active and interact with the sender of information.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>This communication model is named an integrative communication model. Where in the learning process (communication) the sender will start by throwing the main questions that are difficult for students to answer. This will create confusion for students who are the recipients of the message. Students will try hard to understand the meaning of the teacher's question. In this situation, communication runs linearly where the recipient of the message cannot provide feedback and the student is only passive.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>After starting with a main question, the teacher will convey the theory little by little while throwing some rhetorical questions related to the theory presented. In this situation, students will be provoked to continue to answer what is asked by the teacher because the questions are rhetorical, unlike difficult questions at the opening of the lesson. The theory presented by the teacher will slowly be structured into a concept of understanding where the question that was originally rhetorical turns out to be an inducement to the answer to the question at the beginning which silences the class. And at the end of the session where all the theory has been arranged and all the rhetorical questions make a connecting chain. The big questions that become the focus of learning will be answered and understood by students (recipients of information).</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The characteristic of this communication model is that it makes the recipient of the information look like an active person, whereas in fact it is passive because it only provides feedback on an information/question that actually does not require an answer, but only a inducement to achieve the intended goal.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Let’s go over the basic communication model. The model is a visual representation of how a message goes from sender to receiver.</p><p></p><p><strong>Communication Model</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Sender</strong></p><p>The <strong>sender</strong> is the person who wants to deliver a message. Pretty self explanatory, right?</p><p></p><p><strong>Encode</strong></p><p>For a sender to transfer a message, they must first translate the message into symbols for the receiver (the one who receives the message). This means taking thoughts, emotions and images and translating them into something the receiver can understand. These symbols often include:</p><p></p>wordspicturessoundssense information (e.g., touch or smell).<p></p><p>The process of translating these messages into symbols is called <strong>encoding</strong>.</p><p></p><p><strong>Message Channel</strong></p><p>After encoding the message, it’s time to communicate the message to a receiver. To do this, we must pick a <strong>channel</strong> for the message to go through. The channel is the <strong>type of medium used to transmit messages between senders and receivers.</strong> Examples of channels are:</p><p></p><p><strong>Verbal</strong></p>Face-to-faceOver the telephone<p><strong>Written</strong></p>LettersNewspapers<p><strong>Visual Media</strong></p>TelevisionPhotographs<p></p><p><strong>Decode</strong></p><p>Once the message is received by someone, it’s time for the <strong>decoding</strong> process. Just like a sender must encode messages to communicate, receivers must sense and interpret the symbols to fully understand the message. They then decode the symbols back into images, emotions and thoughts to make sense of them.</p><p></p><p><strong>Receiver</strong></p><p>The <strong>receiver</strong> is the person who receives the message.</p><p></p><p><strong>Let’s connect it all.</strong></p><p>Now that you know all of the steps of the communication process, it easily connects. When messages are decoded exactly as the sender has intended, the sender and receiver have matching perceptions of the message being communicated. When everyone is on the same page, effective communication occurs.</p><br />

The name helical comes from “Helix” which means an object having a three-dimensional shape like that of a wire wound uniformly around a cylinder or cone. He shows communication as a dynamic and non-linear process.</p><br />

Fill in the blanks with the word/s that will make the statement correct. Communication came from the ________ word “Communicare” which means to share or to ___________. It is also believed that communication is a certain _________ for it follows a sequence or flow. One of its components is _________ who happens to be the source of information. On the other hand, there is the Message which serves as the thought or idea being sent. The Receiver or also known as the __________ receives the message and answers or response with a____________. Communication has been studied by several proponents already. They have developed different models of it. The Models of Communication is defined as the __________ representations of the proposed element included in the communication process. Some of the models are Lasswell’s Model which was developed by ____________. There is also the Shannon and _________ Model. One of the simplest and easiest model to study is the Schramm’s Model. This model can be viewed with cyclical process and it was developed by ___________. However in David Berlo’s model, he emphasized on the importance of the connection of the encoder and the decoder. This model is called __________________. Last model that you have encountered is proposed by Dean C. Barnlund, It is called as the Barnlund’s Model of communication. This has been different from others because it addressed the ________ type of communication process by developing his ______________ communication process.
