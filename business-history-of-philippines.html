                                            A Heritage of Smallness Society for the Filipino is a small rowboat: the barangay. Geography for the Filipino is a small locality: the barrio. History for the Filipino is a small vague saying matanda pa kay mahoma; noong peacetime. Enterprise for the Filipino is a small stall the sari-sari. Industry and production for the Filipino are the small immediate searchings of each day: isangkahig, isangtuka. And commerce for the Filipino is the smallest degree of retail: the tingi. What most astonishes foreigners in the Philippines is that this is a country, perhaps the only one in the world, where people buy and sell one stick of cigarette, half a head of garlic, a dab of pomade, part of the contents of a can or bottle, one single egg, one single banana. To foreigners used to buying things by the carton or the dozen or pound and in the large economy sizes, the exquisite transactions of Philippine tingis cannot but seem Lilliputian. So much effort by so many for so little. Like all those children risking neck and limb in the traffic to sell one stick of cigarette at a time. Or those grown-up men hunting the sidewalks all day to sell a puppy or a lantern or a pair of socks. The amount of effort they spend seems out of all proportion to the returns.

                                            SINGAPORE SOJOURN 
 By Tammy Mendoza (Excerpt) 
When you’re a visitor in this remarkable state, one impression that you will have is that people tend to ask you how many times you’ve been to Singapore. 
For the past many years, this Asian dragon has become one of the top tourist draws in Asia. Its vibrant economy has made it arguably the gateway in Southeast Asia, and perhaps, on this account, people have grown quite used to tourists seeing Singapore more often than once. 
Last September, our group flew to Singapore on the largesse of Singapore Airlines, unquestionably one of the pillars of the impressive success story of the city-state. Cited several times as the best airline by prestigious international magazines, Singapore Airlines is a showcase of reliability and finesse. 
And so is the famed Changi Airport. Also the object of international distinction, the modern airport has consistently been voted the world’s best, and it provides appropriate, interesting insights of what awaits the Singapore guest. 
Singapore, like the Changi Airport, is a marvel – the fruit of both foresight and careful orchestration. Despite having a land area of only about 650 sq. kms., Singapore has a thriving economy; it has one of the world’s busiest ports, and is conceded as Asia’s business and financial center.
Singapore by night is a thrilling sight, as we arrived in the Apollo Hotel, there seemed to be so much to look forward to in this sprightly city of surprise. 
As for the evening, it belonged to a taxi ride and dinner at Clarke Quay, mainly a cluster of stores by a Singapore river. The highlight of the visit was a taxi ride, where we were taken on a guided tour of the city to better appreciate its history. 
With hindsight, the Singapore sojourn turned out to be a truly splendid experience for the group, specially for some of us who tried Singapore’s night life for more taste of adventure. 
The thing with Singapore is, it doesn’t really matter if you’ve been there before or not at all. Constantly discovering and ever-changing, Singapore is forever new, and it’s never the same way twice.

Rice, however, played an essential role in human history or both then and now. Rice is unlikely to become less significant in the lives and cultures of those who rely on it in the future.

Its a place where people come to learn and grow contributes to people's socioeconomic development and long-term viability. The small in particular small and medium-sized businesses play an important role in improving people's lives, particularly in meeting there ongoing needs and wants.

Geography for the Filipino is a small locality: the barrio. History for the Filipino is a small vague saying: matanda pa kay mahoma; noong peacetime. Enterprise for the Filipino is a small stall: the sari-sari. Industry and production for the Filipino are the small immediate scratching of each day: isang kahig, isang tuka. And commerce for the Filipino is the smallest degree of retail: the tingi. What most astonishes foreigners in the Philippines is that this is a country, perhaps the only one in the world, where people buy and sell one stick of cigarette, half a head of garlic, a dab of pomade, part of the contents of a can or bottle, one single egg, one single banana. To foreigners used to buying things by the carton or the dozen or pound and in the large economy sizes, the exquisite transactions of Philippine tingis cannot but seem Lilliputian. So much effort by so many for so little. Like all those children risking neck and limb in the traffic to sell one stick of cigarette at a time. Or those grown-up men hunting the sidewalks all day to sell a puppy or a lantern or a pair of socks. The amount of effort they spend seems out of all proportion to the returns.

The existence of several fault lines across the country is a manifestation of the movements of these tectonic plates. A fault line is defined as a geological fracture wherein the movement of masses of rock has displaced parts of the Earth's crust. A rapid movement of a fault line may produce a powerful energy that can trigger a strong earthquake. There are five active fault lines in the country namely the Western Philippine Fault, the Eastern Philippine Fault, the South of Mindanao Fault, Central Philippine Fault and the Marikina/Valley Fault System. in Metro Manila, the "Big One" applies to a scenario wherein movements along straddles 10 kilometers in Rizal province while the West Valley Fault runs over more the Valley Fault System could trigger a 7.2-magnitude quake. The East Valley Fault than 100 km through the provinces of Bulacan, Rizal, Cavite and Laguna, and Metro Scientists claimed that the 100-km fault, which last moved in 1658, moves every 400 years, meaning the threat of a 7.2-magnitude quake is getting closer. Over the years, the Philippines has suffered a history of destructive and frequent earthquakes. Destruction of buildings and the loss of lives are not limited to the epicenter and nearby cities of the earthquake. https://business inquirer.net/269314/devastating-faults-of-the-big-one) 1.

                            10. A Heritage of Smallness Society for the Filipino is a small rowboat: the barangay. Geography for the Filipino is a small locality: the barrio. History for the Filipino is a small vague saying matanda pa kay mahoma; noong peacetime. Enterprise for the Filipino is a small stall the sari-sari. Industry and production for the Filipino are the small immediate searchings of each day: isangkahig, isangtuka. And commerce for the Filipino is the smallest degree of retail: the tingi. What most astonishes foreigners in the Philippines is that this is a country, perhaps the only one in the world, where people buy and sell one stick of cigarette, half a head of garlic, a dab of pomade, part of the contents of a can or bottle, one single egg, one single banana. To foreigners used to buying things by the carton or the dozen or pound and in the large economy sizes, the exquisite transactions of Philippine tingis cannot but seem Lilliputian. So much effort by so many for so little. Like all those children risking neck and limb in the traffic to sell one stick of cigarette at a time. Or those grown-up men hunting the sidewalks all day to sell a puppy or a lantern or a pair of socks. The amount of effort they spend seems out of all proportion to the returns. Such folk are, obviously, not enough. Laboriousness just can never be the equal of labor as skill, labor as audacity, labor as enterprise. The Filipino who travels abroad gets to thinking that his is the hardest working country in the world. By six or seven in the morning we are already up on our way to work, shops and markets are openthe wheels of industry are already a grind. Abroad, especially in the West, if you go out at seven in the morning you're in a dead-town. Everybody's still in bed, everything's still closed up. Activity doesn't begin till nine or ten, and ceases promptly at five p.m. By six, the business sections are dead towns again. The entire cities go to sleep on weekends. They have a shorter working day, a shorter working week. Yet they pile up more mileage than we who work all day and all week.

                            12. SINGAPORE SOJOURN 
 By Tammy Mendoza (Excerpt) 
When you’re a visitor in this remarkable state, one impression that you will have is that people tend to ask you how many times you’ve been to Singapore. 
For the past many years, this Asian dragon has become one of the top tourist draws in Asia. Its vibrant economy has made it arguably the gateway in Southeast Asia, and perhaps, on this account, people have grown quite used to tourists seeing Singapore more often than once. 
Last September, our group flew to Singapore on the largesse of Singapore Airlines, unquestionably one of the pillars of the impressive success story of the city-state. Cited several times as the best airline by prestigious international magazines, Singapore Airlines is a showcase of reliability and finesse. 
And so is the famed Changi Airport. Also the object of international distinction, the modern airport has consistently been voted the world’s best, and it provides appropriate, interesting insights of what awaits the Singapore guest. 
Singapore, like the Changi Airport, is a marvel – the fruit of both foresight and careful orchestration. Despite having a land area of only about 650 sq. kms., Singapore has a thriving economy; it has one of the world’s busiest ports, and is conceded as Asia’s business and financial center.
Singapore by night is a thrilling sight, as we arrived in the Apollo Hotel, there seemed to be so much to look forward to in this sprightly city of surprise. 
As for the evening, it belonged to a taxi ride and dinner at Clarke Quay, mainly a cluster of stores by a Singapore river. The highlight of the visit was a taxi ride, where we were taken on a guided tour of the city to better appreciate its history. 
With hindsight, the Singapore sojourn turned out to be a truly splendid experience for the group, specially for some of us who tried Singapore’s night life for more taste of adventure. 
The thing with Singapore is, it doesn’t really matter if you’ve been there before or not at all. Constantly discovering and ever-changing, Singapore is forever new, and it’s never the same way twice.

                            16.                    A Heritage of Smallness                            Nick JoaquinSociety for the Filipino is a small rowboat: the barangay. Geography for the Filipino is a small locality: the barrio. History for the Filipino is a small vague saying: matanda pa kay mahoma; noong peacetime. Enterprise for the Filipino is a small stall: the sari-sari. Industry and production for the Filipino are the small immediate scratching of each day: isang kahig, isang tuka. And commerce for the Filipino is the smallest degree of retail: the tingi. What most astonishes foreigners in the Philippines is that this is a country, perhaps the only one in the world, where people buy and sell one stick of cigarette, half a head of garlic, a dab of pomade, part of the contents of a can or bottle, one single egg, one single banana. To foreigners used to buying things by the carton or the dozen or pound and in the large economy sizes, the exquisite transactions of Philippine tingis cannot but seem Lilliputian. So much effort by so many for so little. Like all those children risking neck and limb in the traffic to sell one stick of cigarette at a time. Or those grown-up men hunting the sidewalks all day to sell a puppy or a lantern or a pair of socks. The amount of effort they spend seems out of all proportion to the returns. Such folk are, obviously, not enough. Laboriousness just can never be the equal of labor as skill, labor as audacity, labor as enterprise.The Filipino who travels abroad gets to thinking that his is the hardest workingcountry in the world. By six or seven in the morning we are already up on our way to work, shops and markets are open; the wheels of industry are already a grind. Abroad, especially in the West, if you go out at seven in the morning you’re in a dead-town. Everybody’s still in bed; everything’s still closed up. Activity doesn’t begin till nine or ten– and ceases promptly at five p.m. By six, the business sections are dead towns again. The entire cities go to sleep on weekends. They have a shorter working day, a shorter working week. Yet they pile up more mileage than we who work all day and all week.1.

Objed inactive fault every day Directions Read the following article then answer the questions that follow Earthquakes occur quite frequently in the Philippines due largely to its location The country lies along the "Pacific Ring of Fire," home to several tectonic plate boundaries that stretch from Indonesia to the coast of Chile within a 40.000-km arc of seismic violence that triggers volcanic eruptions and unleashes earthquakes almost Three tectonic plates that encircle the country are the Philippine Plate in the East the Eurasian Plate in the West; and the Indo-Australian Plate in the South. The existence of several fault lines across the country is a manifestation of the movements of these tectonic plates. A fault line is defined as a geological fracture wherein the movement of masses of rock has displaced parts of the Earth's crust. A rapid movement of a fault line may produce a powerful energy that can trigger a strong earthquake. There are five active fault lines in the country namely the Western Philippine Fault, the Eastern Philippine Fault, the South of Mindanao Fault, Central Philippine Fault and the Marikina/Valley Fault System. in Metro Manila, the "Big One" applies to a scenario wherein movements along straddles 10 kilometers in Rizal province while the West Valley Fault runs over more the Valley Fault System could trigger a 7.2-magnitude quake. The East Valley Fault than 100 km through the provinces of Bulacan, Rizal, Cavite and Laguna, and Metro Scientists claimed that the 100-km fault, which last moved in 1658, moves every 400 years, meaning the threat of a 7.2-magnitude quake is getting closer. Over the years, the Philippines has suffered a history of destructive and frequent earthquakes. Destruction of buildings and the loss of lives are not limited to the epicenter and nearby cities of the earthquake. https://business inquirer.net/269314/devastating-faults-of-the-big-one) 1.
