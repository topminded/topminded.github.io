                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>What are the Different Types of Hotel Ownership?</p><p>Are you thinking about investing in a hotel and wondering about the different types of hotel ownership? You might envision yourself at the helm of a successful B&amp;B operation or walking the halls of your own hotel. There are several types of ownership models and methods to achieve your dream. There are two primary kinds of hotels: independent and chain. That doesn’t mean that if you own a hotel you can’t be part of a popular chain. Within the two designations are several options for ownership.</p><p></p><p>Privately Owned Hotels</p><p>Although one person or company is named as the owner, there may be several investors in this ownership model. The advantage to an independent hotel is that you will have autonomy in management decisions. You can decorate your bed and breakfast however you like or tailor your hotel to accommodate the personality and customs of the community where it is located. You may have to have a consensus of your investors to make some decisions, but the day-to-day operations are up to you. One disadvantage to this setup is that you or your company will have to pay for all advertising and there is no central purchaser of things like linens and other supplies so you won’t have a volume discount.

                            10. A. Identify the needs of individuals, groups, organization and communities about therenewal of franchise of ABS-CBN.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The ABS-CBN franchise renewal controversy is a national dispute in the Philippines regarding the renewal of the congressional franchise that would have allowed Philippine media network ABS-CBN continued broadcasting rights in the Philippines.[8][9][10]
</p><p>
</p><p>Disputes between the government of President Rodrigo Duterte and ABS-CBN arose on the terms and conditions of the franchise renewal agreement. Amid the controversy, the Congress of the Philippines, the legislature of the country, was unable to renew the franchise before its expiration date. The congressional franchise expired on May 4, 2020, as the Philippines was dealing with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon.[11] The next day, exercising constitutional powers, the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) then issued a cease-and-desist order demanding ABS-CBN to immediately cease all of its free TV and radio broadcasting. ABS-CBN complied with the government order and signed-off all of its radio stations and free television channels later that day.[8] On June 30, 2020, the NTC and Solicitor General Jose Calida released two alias cease-and-desist orders against ABS-CBN TV Plus and Sky Direct.[12]
</p><p>
</p><p>Beginning in 2014, the network had repeatedly applied for the renewal of their broadcast franchise through private bills that had been pending in the House of Representatives but had not been addressed by the 16th, 17th, and 18th congresses of the Philippines.[8][9][13] Prominent figures in ABS-CBN Corporation, the political opposition in the Philippines, media advocacy groups,[9] and the international press[8][11] have labeled the refusal of Congress to renew the franchise as a result of President Duterte's pressure for ABS-CBN to cease broadcasting, and a direct attack on the country's democracy and press freedoms. Duterte's ruling coalition maintains a supermajority in both chambers of Congress,[14][15] and the President criticized the ABS-CBN Network for their allegedly biased and unfavorable news coverage against Duterte beginning with his presidential campaign in the 2016 Philippine presidential election,[16] repeatedly voicing his opposition against the renewal of the network's congressional franchise.[17] ABS-CBN subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court of the Philippines to nullify as unconstitutional the cease-and-desist order.
</p><p>
</p><p>The resulting franchise expiration and withdrawal of its broadcast rights marked the first time ABS-CBN, considered a historical and cultural icon in the Philippines, had been off the air since the 1986 revolution, having been seized and liquidated by the authoritarian government of the Martial Law dictatorship from 1972 until the regime's collapse in 1986.[8] Critics of the Duterte government consider the NTC's cease-and-desist order and the denial of the franchise application as contributing to a growing democratic backsliding in the Philippines under the Duterte administration.</p><p><strong>Explanation: </strong></p><strong>HOPE IT HELPS</strong><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Franchising is an important part of the tourism and hospitality industry, as it allows business owners to expand their business with the help of an established brand. By franchising, business owners can benefit from the marketing, operational, and financial support of the franchisor. This makes it much easier for the business owner to open and operate a successful business.</p><p></p><p>If given a chance, I would franchise a restaurant business. I would manage the franchise business by ensuring that I follow all the guidelines and procedures provided by the franchisor. I would also hire competent staff and provide the best customer service possible. I would ensure that the restaurant follows the franchisor’s menu and pricing guidelines, as well as all operational policies. I would also make sure that the restaurant is up-to-date with the latest trends in the food industry. Finally, I would actively seek out new customers and promote the business within the local community.</p><br />

You might envision yourself at the helm of a successful B&amp;B operation or walking the halls of your own hotel. There are several types of ownership models and methods to achieve your dream. There are two primary kinds of hotels: independent and chain. That doesn’t mean that if you own a hotel you can’t be part of a popular chain. Within the two designations are several options for ownership.</p><p></p><p>Privately Owned Hotels</p><p></p><p>Although one person or company is named as the owner, there may be several investors in this ownership model. The advantage to an independent hotel is that you will have autonomy in management decisions.

You may have to have a consensus of your investors to make some decisions, but the day-to-day operations are up to you.

Its reputation was tarnished as the budget hotels became targets of crime and many of the hotels were not properly maintained. The chain underwent a massive restructuring, renovation program and re-branding to improve their lagging ratings and revenue. In addition, if you own a franchised hotel, you must adhere to the chain’s standards, practices and often their decorating and floor plans. You are not autonomous in the management decisions either. Still, this model offers the advantage of affiliation with a well-known brand, central procurement of supplies and some support services.</p><p></p><p>Although there may be other models, these represent the most prevalent. As a prospective owner, you will have to research the options carefully, including the capital that you have available for your investment.

</p><p>Choosing a Service Franchise or a Product Franchisewww.franchisehelp.com › franchisee-resource-center
</p><p>Since their brand is associated with a tangible good they must guarantee the desired quality from the consumer's expectation. Franchisees must purchase the goods from a designated supplier and must keep items in their inventory as suggested by the franchisor.
