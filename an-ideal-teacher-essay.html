                            5. What are the personal chracteristics of an ideal teacher?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>So what makes a good teacher?</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Good Teachers Are Strong Communicators. </strong></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Good Teachers Listen Well. </strong></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Good Teachers Focus on Collaboration.</strong></p><p><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Good Teachers Are Adaptable. </strong></p><p><strong>5</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Good Teachers Are Engaging. </strong></p><p><strong>6</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Good Teachers Show Empathy. </strong></p><p><strong>7</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Good Teachers Have Patience. </strong></p><p><strong>8</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Good Teachers Share Best Practices.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Every teacher wants to be good, but what exactly are the qualities that make a good teacher? What are the skills, talents, and characteristics, and can they be taught or learned?</p><p></p><p>Teaching can be quite satisfying for people who do it well. I know this because I am a teacher, too. Although I do not think I'm always the best teacher, do I know that the majority of my students love me, and I guess this is partly why good things happen in my classroom.</p><p></p><p>I have spent a lot of time thinking about—and done a lot of research into—the question of what characteristics make a teacher effective and how I can succeed in the classroom. Although every great teacher has their own special, unique style, I have found that there are nine specific universal qualities that are necessary for anyone who wants to teach effectively, whether they want to teach in an elementary school or a university. If any teacher possesses the following characteristics and qualities, he/she can become a very good teacher with large fan base.</p><p></p><p>Education is not the filling of a pail but the lighting of a fire.</p><p></p><p>1. Excellent Communication Skills</p><p>You'd think that the most important quality for a teacher to possess would be knowledge, since that's what the job is all about, after all: sharing knowledge. But no matter how knowledgable a person is, if they can't convey what they know to others in a way that is not only understandable but engaging, the knowledge itself is useless.</p><p></p><p>If a teacher's communication skills (verbal, nonverbal, and visual, which involve speaking, writing, imagery, body language, and the organization of ideas into understandable structures) are good, they can convey knowledge with better skill and results.</p><p>Since a large part of good communication is knowing when the audience has understood, these teachers notice when they have communicated effectively and when they have not. They will often paraphrase, illustrate, or take another tact entirely when it becomes apparent that their communication has fallen flat or has not reached or connected to the entire class.</p><p>A good teacher notices when even one student among many does not understand, and makes an effort to communicate individually when necessary.</p><p>Communication also involves explaining exactly what the assignments and expectations are. When students fully understand what is expected of them, it's much easier for them to deliver.</p><p>Interestingly, not only are communication skills incredibly important in the classroom, but they are among the most important skills in any setting. According to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center, most Americans view communication as the most important skill for long term success “to get ahead in the world today.” So by being good communicators, teachers are modeling important lifetime skills by example.</p><p>2. Superior Listening Skills</p><p>In addition to being good communicators, good teachers also happen to be excellent listeners. As the Turkish proverb says,"If speaking is silver, then listening is gold." Of course, effective communication only happens when at least two parties are actively involved in the process together, and the only way to know if communication is heard is by asking (and listening to the answer).</p><p></p><p>So in an ideal learning environment, teachers ask important questions and then actively, carefully, empathetically listen to what learners have to say. When good teachers develop this patient quality in themselves, they start to become great. Great teachers listen hard and then use what they hear to improve the communication.</p><p></p><p></p><p>My kadogtong payan sa comment section mahaba kasi hirap din mag type</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My Ideal Self Who/what do you want to achieve/have, why? In the shorter term (3 years), I want to graduate from HELP University’s Degree of Psychology in first-class honours. I understand claims stating such academic achievement is merely a graduation certificate, without guarantee of work opportunities. However, my aim is not motivated towards work opportunities or anything materialistic; I just want to appreciate and value every learning opportunity. Besides viewing this process as a foundation for future knowledge and abilities, I have been anticipating this stage of gaining deeper and professional knowledge in psychology for a long time. To summarize, this goal is elicited from my passion and enthusiasm for psychology, to remain focused throughout these three years, instead of gaining fame or impress others. After graduation, I want to engage in a job related to psychology, allowing me to serve others by applying the knowledge learnt. It may not need to be anything very great; I just hope to contribute to the society’s wellbeing, whether it is in the clinical setting, corporate world or any other aspects. Most importantly, I hope to raise awareness and acceptance towards mental disorders. Even though my effort alone may not be significant to the society, I believe that my effort would at least support those in my surrounding</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>my ideal family is having happy , contented, blessed and understanding family members.</p><p></p><p>when your family is supportive you'll felt blessed because nothing else your going to wish for you just need to pray for their health </p><p></p>
꒰ Answer ꒱ˀˀ ↷<p>        For me, an ideal family would be a family who never fails to show care and appreciation. This attitude in our family is always present because we talk to each other when a member in our family is having problems. We never fail to pray together during Sundays and before having our meals. This is a fact that m,y ideal family and my own have many similarities because we help and protect each other as a complete family.
</p><p>
</p><p>       Lastly, an ideal family for me always accepts each member in the family for who they are. A family who will always be there for you every time and accepts you for your failures and mistakes. My family takes the role of forming my own identity and accepting me for myself. All of us will stand together against any problem that arises in our family. This is what makes my family similar to my ideal family.</p><p></p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>its just an example, but u can refer to the essay</p><p></p><p></p>

                            30. Write an essay about your IDEAL PERSON</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>My Ideal Person Essay</strong><p>Human beings are not perfect. We all have some form of deficiency that deny us the coveted tag of perfection. It may be a character flaw or a physical disability. We all have something that we are not proud of. Something that makes us so uncomfortable that our confidence levels plummet to zero whenever we think about it.</p><p></p><p></p><p>While there are things we cannot change about ourselves, such as height, intelligence, race or size of our fingers, there are other factors in our lives that we can change and they are the ones that really matter. We are not remembered for our tallness or brownness, we are remembered for our virtues or vices. Therefore, an ideal person is one who possesses all character traits that are considered virtues in society.</p><p></p><p></p><p>When I talk about an ideal person, one person comes to mind- Mother Teresa. Her name has become synonymous with sacrifice and selfless generosity. People know her from all over the world, both in the religious and secular circles. Though she was not perfect, her life embodied what I would refer to as the ideal personality. One of her best qualities was piety. She was a very faithful and religious woman.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Mother Teresa was a staunch catholic. At the tender age of 18 years, she joined the Sisters of Loreto in Dublin and became a nun. She therefore dedicated all her life towards a religious and humanitarian course and never looked back. There were instances where she felt like God had forgotten her and even questioned whether God really existed. However, she never left her catholic faith.</p><p></p><p></p><p>She was also very generous. She spent most of her life serving the poor. Form her own account, which she labeled as “a call within a call,” God spoke to her and commanded her to go help the slum dwellers in Calcutta, India. After receiving approval from Vatican, she relocated to Calcutta for the rest of her life. Using her meagre resources, she wholeheartedly helped the poor and the sick.</p><p></p><p></p><p>She left behind a lifestyle of stability and opulence, took a vow of charity, chastity and poverty and then went to a foreign country to live with the destitute. During her life, she suffered from many illnesses and injuries, including malaria, pneumonia and two heart attacks. She also had broken collar bone. The several setbacks she faced however did not deter her from moving on with her course.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Mother Teresa was also a leader and she led by example. When she saw things were not okay and people were suffering, she took it upon herself to help them. With all the poverty and misery that surrounded her, she always had the strength to put on a smile. One of the traits of great leaders is that they always give people hope when there seems to be none.</p><p></p><p></p><p>That was Mother Teresa. People rushed to her for comfort and assistance and she always found a way to help them. When she arrived in Calcutta, there was wide spread of diseases in the slums. She went to a medical institution, trained to be practitioner and went back to the slums to treat the affected. She also established various health centers to deal with the rampant spread of diseases, including leprosy that was wreaking havoc in the slums.</p><p></p><p>She was also very principled. She had her own set of beliefs that she followed to the letter and never faltered whenever she faced criticism or opposition. She openly opposed divorce, abortion and contraception. While receiving her Nobel Peace Prize for her unwavering service to humanity, she aired her critique on abortion without fear. She opined in her speech, “…I feel the greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion, because it is a direct war- a direct murder by the mother herself…” Although she received too much public backlash for her stance on abortion, contraception and divorce, she was unperturbed and made it clear to the whole world about her position.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
