This study examined the relationship of book and e-book, this paper tends to identify in 1 affects reading comprehension. Three out of ten students in the Philippines are more hooked to reading materials published online. This paper's objectives aim to find the centre problem of the respondents when it comes to understanding complex material. 2. The physical "brick and mortar" classroom is starting to lose its monopoly as the place of learning. The Internet has made online learning possible, and many researchers and educators are interested in online learning to enhance and improve student learning outcomes while combating the reduction in resources, particularly in higher education. It is only three percent of the population worldwide compared to traditional face-to-face format and the factors that influence the effectiveness of online courses. This study examines the evidence of the effectiveness of online learning by organizing and summarizing the findings and challenges of online learning into positive, negative, mixed, and null findings. 3. The purpose of this study was comparing effectiveness of methods of presentation of concept maps and methods of concept mapping on reading comprehension. The subjects of this study consisted of sixty-six third-year high school students (thirty-three female, thirty-three male), that were selected randomly by multistage sampling method. Participants were randomly assigned to three treatment groups and 1 control group. The research instruments were: 1) experimental texts, 2) comprehension test, and 3) Camp Tools software, and 4) Teacher-generated concept maps. Treatment groups included computer-based concept mapping, paper-pencils concept mapping, and reading text with prepared concept maps. The control group for the study did not receive any concept map. The results of this study indicated that presentation of per-prepared concept maps significantly improved comprehension, compared to the map generation and control group. But paper- pencil and computer-based concept mapping compared to the control groups were not statistically significant. The best way for use of concept maps is teacher-generated concept maps with texts.pahelp plesss ​</a>

Write the answer in the notebook. Companion Day At the edge of his seat, Gerald watched Master Arthur call each student to the stage. Companion Day was finally here! Today, the students would receive their companion creatures-creatures picked just for them, each with a certain magical power. The students would grow up alongside their creatures, learning how to use these powers to help others. Gerald heard Ming gasp in delight as Master Arthur handed her a snowy owl, the clear choice for someone so patient and smart. Owls helped others find information, guiding them to books, maps, and other resources. Nearby, Ollie, known for his wild imagination, cuddled a baby unicorn. Gerald knew it was too much to wish for a dragon-but somebody had gotten one the year before, so it was possible! Finally, Master Arthur called Gerald's name. Gerald ran up to the stage. Master Arthur handed him a small glass bowl that contained his companion creature. Gerald squinted through the glass, confused, as his classmates began to whisper and murmur.​</a>

This study examined the relationship of book and e-book, this paper tends to identify in 1 affects reading comprehension. Three out of ten students in the Philippines are more hooked to reading materials published online. This paper's objectives aim to find the centre problem of the respondents when it comes to understanding complex material. 2. The physical "brick and mortar" classroom is starting to lose its monopoly as the place of learning. The Internet has made online learning possible, and many researchers and educators are interested in online learning to enhance and improve student learning outcomes while combating the reduction in resources, particularly in higher education. It is only three percent of the population worldwide compared to traditional face-to-face format and the factors that influence the effectiveness of online courses. This study examines the evidence of the effectiveness of online learning by organizing and summarizing the findings and challenges of online learning into positive, negative, mixed, and null findings. 3. The purpose of this study was comparing effectiveness of methods of presentation of concept maps and methods of concept mapping on reading comprehension. The subjects of this study consisted of sixty-six third-year high school students (thirty-three female, thirty-three male), that were selected randomly by multistage sampling method. Participants were randomly assigned to three treatment groups and 1 control group. The research instruments were: 1) experimental texts, 2) comprehension test, and 3) Camp Tools software, and 4) Teacher-generated concept maps. Treatment groups included computer-based concept mapping, paper-pencils concept mapping, and reading text with prepared concept maps. The control group for the study did not receive any concept map. The results of this study indicated that presentation of per-prepared concept maps significantly improved comprehension, compared to the map generation and control group. But paper- pencil and computer-based concept mapping compared to the control groups were not statistically significant. The best way for use of concept maps is teacher-generated concept maps with texts.pahelp plesss ​</h2><br />

                            25. Learning Task #2 Read the story and identify three situations that can be real and three situations that are make-believe. Write the answer in the notebook. Companion Day At the edge of his seat, Gerald watched Master Arthur call each student to the stage. Companion Day was finally here! Today, the students would receive their companion creatures-creatures picked just for them, each with a certain magical power. The students would grow up alongside their creatures, learning how to use these powers to help others. Gerald heard Ming gasp in delight as Master Arthur handed her a snowy owl, the clear choice for someone so patient and smart. Owls helped others find information, guiding them to books, maps, and other resources. Nearby, Ollie, known for his wild imagination, cuddled a baby unicorn. Gerald knew it was too much to wish for a dragon-but somebody had gotten one the year before, so it was possible! Finally, Master Arthur called Gerald's name. Gerald ran up to the stage. Master Arthur handed him a small glass bowl that contained his companion creature. Gerald squinted through the glass, confused, as his classmates began to whisper and murmur.​</h2><br />
