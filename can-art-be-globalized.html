The National Museum of Natural History finally opened to an eager public on Friday, May 18, a fitting commemoration of International Museum Day, the global event than seeks to raise awareness of museums as repositories of heritage, history, and humanity, The natural history museum completes the triumvirate of Manila's very own museum complex. The first two are the National Museum of Fine Arts, which houses the national art collection, and the National Museum of Anthropology, home to the San Diego galle- on artifacts and the Manunggul burial jar. Today, it's not unusual to see long queues at any of the three museums, with families and groups of students excited to see priceless Filipino treasures, such as the Spoliarium by Juan Luna and curiosities like the skeletal remains of "Lolong" the giant crocodile. Manila can now take pride at having its own museum complex, like other great cities of the world. The opening of the National Museum of Natural History, our very own Smithsonian, hopefully changes the character of Filipino families' Sunday excursions. Purpose:​</a>

Read each of the following passages. Tell whether its purpose is to inform, to entertain, or
to persuade.
1. The National Museum of Natural History finally opened to an eager public on Friday,
May 18, a fitting commemoration of International Museum Day, the global event that
seeks to raise awareness of museums as repositories of heritage, history, and humanity.
The natural history museum completes the triumvirate of Manila's very own museum
complex. The first two are the National Museum of Fine Arts, which houses the national
art collection; and the National Museum of Anthropology, home to the San Diego galle-
on artifacts and the Manunggul burial jar.
... Today, it's not unusual to see long queues at any of the three museums, with fami-
lies and groups of students excited to see priceless Filipino treasures, such as the Spoliar-
ium by Juan Luna and curiosities like the skeletal remains of "Lolong," the giant crocodile.
Manila can now take pride at having its own museum complex, like other great cities
of the world. The opening of the National Museum of Natural History, our very own
Smithsonian, hopefully changes the character of Filipino families' Sunday excursions.

One way to bring the people back to their cultural roots is to revive the Cambodian arts, including their literature, music, and performing arts. Also, the state has established monuments and schools to educate the Cambodians on the field of arts. Myanmar also did the same in preserving their culture. However, the big challenge is preserving their cultural heritage. This is due to the fast urbanization of Myanmar. This is why the Myanmar government adapted the intang ble Cultural Heritage Convention of 2003 from the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to preserve their cultural heritage such as monuments and cultural sites (Aspillaga 2013). Countries all over the world, including the Philippines have different ways in keeping their cultures alive. Culture serves as our identity as a nation. Therefore, it is of great importance that governments give priority to preserving one's culture. It is indeed the soul of a nation. 语 What is culture based on the given text? Why is culture considered as the soul of every nation? In the Philippines, can you name museums and local heritage sites that represent the culture of our country? As Filipinos, how should we preserve our culture like our Asian neighboring countries?​</a>

to persuade.
1. The National Museum of Natural History finally opened to an eager public on Friday,
May 18, a fitting commemoration of International Museum Day, the global event that
seeks to raise awareness of museums as repositories of heritage, history, and humanity.
The natural history museum completes the triumvirate of Manila's very own museum
complex. The first two are the National Museum of Fine Arts, which houses the national
art collection; and the National Museum of Anthropology, home to the San Diego galle-
on artifacts and the Manunggul burial jar.
... Today, it's not unusual to see long queues at any of the three museums, with fami-
lies and groups of students excited to see priceless Filipino treasures, such as the Spoliar-
ium by Juan Luna and curiosities like the skeletal remains of "Lolong," the giant crocodile.
Manila can now take pride at having its own museum complex, like other great cities
of the world. The opening of the National Museum of Natural History, our very own
Smithsonian, hopefully changes the character of Filipino families' Sunday excursions.

However, due to globalization, it has become a challenge for both countries to preserve their cultures. This problem arose in Cambodia spectically after the Khmer Rouge. One way to bring the people back to their cultural roots is to revive the Cambodian arts, including their literature, music, and performing arts. Also, the state has established monuments and schools to educate the Cambodians on the field of arts. Myanmar also did the same in preserving their culture. However, the big challenge is preserving their cultural heritage. This is due to the fast urbanization of Myanmar. This is why the Myanmar government adapted the intang ble Cultural Heritage Convention of 2003 from the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to preserve their cultural heritage such as monuments and cultural sites (Aspillaga 2013). Countries all over the world, including the Philippines have different ways in keeping their cultures alive. Culture serves as our identity as a nation. Therefore, it is of great importance that governments give priority to preserving one's culture. It is indeed the soul of a nation. 语 What is culture based on the given text? Why is culture considered as the soul of every nation? In the Philippines, can you name museums and local heritage sites that represent the culture of our country?

                        <p>1. <strong>In the history of human civilization, Dr. Jose Rizal became one of the so-called Renaissance men, polymaths, and universal geniuses.</strong></p>He was a Filipino nationalist and one of the few globally-known Renaissance men.A Renaissance man is an intelligent someone who succeeds in multiple topics or fields. Unfortunately, just 28 men in human history are acknowledged. Dr. Jose Rizal is the most recent and final individual in line.Dr. Jose Rizal, the Philippine National Hero, is comparable to Mahatma Gandhi in India. He possesses excellent brains and extraordinary abilities.This Renaissance person was an author, sculptor, painter, educator, farmer, historian and journalist. <p>2. <strong>Dr. Jose Rizal's qualities and attributes did obtain him to be acknowledged as such by global scholars and experts when he was a scholar, scientist, physician, and author, as well as the most eminent influencer. </strong></p>Born in 1861 to an affluent Chinese mestizo family in Laguna Province, he had early signs of exceptional brilliance. He learned to read and write at the age of two and grew up to speak more than twenty languages, including Latin, Greek, French, German, and Chinese.In 1882, after completing three years of medical studies at the University of Santo Tomás, he traveled to Spain to complete his education at the University of Madrid. In the decade that followed, Dr. Jose Rizal's career spanned two worlds: among small communities of Filipino students in Madrid and other European cities, he became a leader and eloquent spokesperson, and in the broader world of European science and scholarship — particularly in Germany — he developed close relationships with prominent natural and social scientists. The new field of anthropology was of great interest to him, and he was determined to refute the friar's preconceived notions of Filipino problems inferiority using scientific evidence.Dr. Jose Rizal's Austrian friend, Professor Ferdinand Blumentritt, rector of the Imperial Atheneum of Leitmeritz, said, "Rizal was the greatest product of the Philippines, and his coming to the world was like the appearance of a rare comet, whose rare brilliance appears only once every century." Dr. Adolf B. Meyer, director of the Dresden Museum, admired Rizal's general knowledge and ability. Dr. Camilo Osias referred to him as a "versatile genius," remarking, "Rizal's multifacetedness was astounding."<p></p><p><strong>3.

In addition, he was a prolific poet, essayist, and novelist whose most well-known works were the novels Noli Me Tángere (1887) and El filibusterismo (1900)</p><p><strong>- Science</strong></p><p>He created a vast and well-known medical practice that attracted patients from the Philippines, Hong Kong, and other places in Asia. He developed a hospital. He constructed a small dwelling for himself and a huge one for his family and guests. He acquired land and engaged in scientific farming.</p><p><strong>- Fine arts</strong></p><p>Dr. Jose Rizal was highly adaptable and possessed considerable skills. He created numerous paintings, drawings, and sculptures. Having several sweethearts, he primarily used oil on canvas to create portraits of his name. Additionally, he made some for his pals, including Ferdinand Blummentritt and Juan Luna.</p><p><strong>- Medicine</strong></p><p>In 1887, Dr. Jose Rizal returned to his birthplace and practiced ophthalmology and general medicine for almost one year. His reputation as an eye surgeon mirrored his burgeoning political reputation. Filipinos recognized him as a man of miracles who could restore sight to the blind.</p><p><strong>- Linguistic</strong></p><p>Dr. Jose Rizal's published language studies are a small percentage of his work.
