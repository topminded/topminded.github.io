                                            Do you know who you are? When you look at yourself in the mirror, what do you see? The best version of yourself? A façade? A blank picture of yourself? Or you have got amnesia? Or where you can no longer feel your inner self? That's the worst feeling one could ever have and comparable to dark night. What you see in the mirror is exactly what you see, what you get, and what you are. Again, the question is who you are. This poses you to rediscover who you truly are and how to reveal, Predefine, and reactivate yourself again.To turn to your original condition, every time you broke your inner senses, every time you were struck by your fears, every time you lost courage and hope, and every time you failed. Blindfolded with all the shams and drudgeries in life, we are curtailed to bring out the best in us. The challenge is there all the time, put your blindfolded off, for this is just a test of life. Remembering and believing who we are,. is just the start of living life to the fullest again this is the first step. Next is to live the truth. You are created for a purpose and thus loved by God. With this, you will experience healing inside and your completeness through Him will then radiate love and joy to others too. No philosophers, even the best ones can give us the best ways to overcome our personal challenges. It is just our relationship with God. The best system is prayer. When you ray, you talk to God and your journey with Him will take place. It is our pause from time to time that we will be refreshed with something new, something better, a fresh start, a clean state, and a new journey to begin again. We can choose differently! Remember, what matters most is not how others see you, but how you truly see yourself. Who are you when you are all alone? When no one is watching? How do you see yourself determines how you allow people to treat you? How you see yourself dictates what you expect from others, from life, from God. Choose today to be the greatest version of yourself. Do not forget to wear the best make-up SMILE, and the world will smile at you.Eden Grace C.

                                            Do you know who you are? When you look at yourself in the mirror, what do you see? The best version of yourself? A façade? A blank picture of yourself? Or you have got amnesia? Or where you can no longer feel your inner self? That's the worst feeling one could ever have and comparable to dark night. What you see in the mirror is exactly what you see, what you get, and what you are. Again, the question is who you are. This poses you to rediscover who you truly are and how to reveal, Predefine, and reactivate yourself again.To turn to your original condition, every time you broke your inner senses, every time you were struck by your fears, every time you lost courage and hope, and every time you failed. Blindfolded with all the shams and drudgeries in life, we are curtailed to bring out the best in us. The challenge is there all the time, put your blindfolded off, for this is just a test of life. Remembering and believing who we are,. is just the start of living life to the fullest again this is the first step. Next is to live the truth. You are created for a purpose and thus loved by God. With this, you will experience healing inside and your completeness through Him will then radiate love and joy to others too. No philosophers, even the best ones can give us the best ways to overcome our personal challenges. It is just our relationship with God. The best system is prayer. When you ray, you talk to God and your journey with Him will take place. It is our pause from time to time that we will be refreshed with something new, something better, a fresh start, a clean state, and a new journey to begin again. We can choose differently! Remember, what matters most is not how others see you, but how you truly see yourself. Who are you when you are all alone? When no one is watching? How do you see yourself determines how you allow people to treat you? How you see yourself dictates what you expect from others, from life, from God. Choose today to be the greatest version of yourself. Do not forget to wear the best make-up SMILE, and the world will smile at you.Eden Grace C.

I personally suffer with depression and on top of that, I am a huge extrovert.

Hell, it was    nightmare.</p><p></p><p>I think the way I really overcame this issue was simply accepting the circumstances and trying to love myself a lot more. The pandemic was beyond anyone's control and I think many of us even began to shift blame onto ourselves out of sheer frustration.

                            23. Do you know who you are? When you look at yourself in the mirror, what do you see? The best version of yourself? A façade? A blank picture of yourself? Or you have got amnesia? Or where you can no longer feel your inner self? That's the worst feeling one could ever have and comparable to dark night. What you see in the mirror is exactly what you see, what you get, and what you are. Again, the question is who you are. This poses you to rediscover who you truly are and how to reveal, Predefine, and reactivate yourself again.To turn to your original condition, every time you broke your inner senses, every time you were struck by your fears, every time you lost courage and hope, and every time you failed. Blindfolded with all the shams and drudgeries in life, we are curtailed to bring out the best in us. The challenge is there all the time, put your blindfolded off, for this is just a test of life.

No philosophers, even the best ones can give us the best ways to overcome our personal challenges. It is just our relationship with God. The best system is prayer. When you ray, you talk to God and your journey with Him will take place. It is our pause from time to time that we will be refreshed with something new, something better, a fresh start, a clean state, and a new journey to begin again. We can choose differently! Remember, what matters most is not how others see you, but how you truly see yourself. Who are you when you are all alone? When no one is watching? How do you see yourself determines how you allow people to treat you? How you see yourself dictates what you expect from others, from life, from God. Choose today to be the greatest version of yourself. Do not forget to wear the best make-up SMILE, and the world will smile at you.Eden Grace C.
