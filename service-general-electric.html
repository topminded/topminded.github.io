_____ Electricity flows from the power plant through wires to the step-up transformer.
The transformer raises the voltage so it can travel long distances – it is raised to
as high as 756, 000 volts.
_____ Electricity is taken through the lines to a pole transformer – or a transformer
box if underground – and voltage is lowered again to 120 or 220 or 240 volts.
____ From there, electricity comes into your home through a service box, where your
meter is located to measure how much you use. Wires take electricity around
your home, powering your lights and all your other electrical appliances.
_____ Steam is generated in the power plant by burning fossil fuels or by nuclear
fission or geothermal energy.
_____ The electric current then runs through the power lines to the substation
transformer where voltage is lowered to between 2000 and 13000 volts.
_____ The steam powers a turbine which spins a huge magnet inside a copper wire.
Heat energy converts to mechanical energy which then converts to electrical
energy in the generator.</a>

I. The steam powers a turbine which spins a huge magnet inside a copper wire. Heat energyconverts to mechanical energy which then converts to electrical energy in the generator.
II. The electric current then runs through the power lines to the substation transformer wherevoltage is lowered to between 2000 and 13000 volts.
III. From there, electricity comes into your home through a service box, where your meter is
located to measure how much you use. Wires take electricity around your home, poweringyour lights and all your other electrical appliances.
IV. Electricity is then taken through the lines to a pole transformer – or a transformer box ifunderground – and voltage is lowered again to 120 or 220 or 240 volts.
V. Steam is generated in the power plant by the burning of fossil fuels or by nuclear fission orgeothermal energy.
VI. Electricity flows from the power plant through wires to the step up transformer. The transformer raises the voltage so it can travel long distances – it is raised to as high as 756,000 volts.

Then arrange the correct path of electricity from the generation station, transmission and residential areas. (5 pts.)B.a. The steam powers a turbine which spins a huge magnet inside a copper wire. Heat energy converts to mechanical energy which then converts to electrical energy in the generator.b. The electric current then runs through the power lines to the substation transformer where voltage is lowered to between 2000 and 13000 volts.C. Electricity flows from the power plant through wires tothe step up transformer. The transformer raises thevoltage so it can travel long distances - its raised ashigh as 756,000 volts.d. Electricity is then taken through the lines to a pole transformer- or a transformer box if underground - and voltage is lowered again to between 120 and 240 volts.e. From here electricity comes into your home through a service box, where your meter is located to measure how much you use. Wires take electricity around your home powering your lights and all your other appliances.please  answer f. Steam is generated at the electricity plant by the burning of fossil fuels - or at a nuclear or hydroelectric plant.​</a>

Then arrange the correct path of electricity from the generation station, transmission and residential areas. (5 pts.)B.a. The steam powers a turbine which spins a huge magnet inside a copper wire. Heat energy converts to mechanical energy which then converts to electrical energy in the generator.b. The electric current then runs through the power lines to the substation transformer where voltage is lowered to between 2000 and 13000 volts.C. Electricity flows from the power plant through wires tothe step up transformer. The transformer raises thevoltage so it can travel long distances - its raised ashigh as 756,000 volts.d. Electricity is then taken through the lines to a pole transformer- or a transformer box if underground - and voltage is lowered again to between 120 and 240 volts.e. From here electricity comes into your home through a service box, where your meter is located to measure how much you use. Wires take electricity around your home powering your lights and all your other appliances.please  answer f. Steam is generated at the electricity plant by the burning of fossil fuels - or at a nuclear or hydroelectric plant.​</h2><br />
