Its GDP shrunk hy two tenths ofme percent for the first time in two decades according to Secretary SonyDomingues or the Department of Finance (DOF).

MANILA, Philippines — About P10.2 billion from the Philippine Health Insurance Corp.’s (PhilHealth) budget was “potentially lost” to fraudulent transactions and schemes in 2019. 
This loss could balloon to P18 billion by next year if not addressed properly, PhilHealth president Ricardo Morales revealed on Tuesday during a Senate inquiry on the alleged corruption in the agency. Morales, citing a study in December last year, said the state insurer’s fraud index rate was at 7.5%, while the global average is at 10% to 20%. “In other words, of the 176 billion spent by PhilHealth last year of benefit payments, P10.2 billion was potentially lost to fraud,” he said. “Next year, if the right thing is not done, of the P240 billion planned benefit expenditure, this potential loss could balloon to P18 billion,” the PhilHealth president added. The “systematic” fraud plaguing the agency will only be stemmed by a “robust, integrated, and harmonized information management system” that could run a membership database, Morales claimed. He added that the current information management system of PhilHealth is “fragmented, aging and overextended ministered by overworked IT professionals.” However, the IT project of PhilHealth, which is supposedly designed to stop fraud and scams within the agency, was flagged as “overpriced” by government auditors.</a>

                                            SINGAPORE SOJOURN by Tammy Mendoza When you're a visitor in this remarkable state, one impression that you will have is that people tend to ask you how many times you've been in Singapore. For the past many years, this Asian dragon has become one of the top tourist draws in Asia. Its vibrant economy has made it arguably the gateway in Southeast Asia, and perhaps, on this account, people have grown quite used to tourists seeing Singapore more often than once. Last September, our group flew to Singapore on the largesse of Singapore Airlines, unquestionably one of the pillars of the impressive success story of the city-state. Cited several times as the best airline by prestigious international magazines, Singapore Airlines is a showcase reliability and finesse. And so is the famed Changi Airport. Also, the object of international distinction, the modern airport has consistently been voted the world’s best, and it proves appropriate, interesting insights of what awaits the Singapore guest. Singapore, like the Changi Airport, is a marvel - the fruit of both foresight and careful orchestration. Despite having a land area of only about 650 square kilometers. Singapore has a thriving economy. It has one of the world’s busiest ports, and is conceded as Asia's business and financial center. Singapore by night is a thrilling sight, as we arrived in the Apollo Hotel, there seemed to be so much to look forward to in this sprightly city of surprise. Our next stop was the Night Safari. Now a popular attraction of Singapore, the Nights Safari was probably our best experiences. It features over 1000 nocturnal creatures which one can see either by tram or trail. Because of the way the park was developed, the creatures can be seen in their natural habitat without wire harnesses. Fittingly, Singapore's Night Safari received the 1995 ASEAN Tourism Association, Award for Excellence as the best New Tourist Attraction in the ASEAN. Next in line was the Sentosa Island. Accessible from certain points by MRT - Singapore Mass Transit System, bus, or cable car. Sentosa Island is a destination in itself. World, Volcanoland, and Cinemania, Images of Singapore, Fantasy Island, Cinemania.After a hearty lunch at Timbua Restaurant, where we had our fill of delectable Indonesian cuisine, we spent the afternoon looking around spent the afternoon looking around Orchard Road, Singapore's shopping paradise. Along the tretch of Orchard Road can be found mall upon quality merchandise for every mold of shopper. After a generous breakfast buffet, we were whisked to the Singapore Science Center. It was here that we viewed a film at Southeast Asians only Omnimax Theater, where images projected on a dome screen gave us the feeling of being engulfed in the picture. Besides the Omninimax Theater, the Singapore Science enter also houses a variety of exhibits on the life science, technology discoveries, and aviation. As for the evening, it belonged to a taxi ride and dinner at Clark's Quay, mainly a cluster of stores by a Singapore river. The highlight of the visit was a taxi ride, where we were taken on a guided tour of the city to better appreciate its history. The following day, the group had splendid time at the Jurong Birdpark which a co-passenger on the taxi ride at Clarks Quay said was his personal choice as the best attraction of Singapore. Here we had breakfast with the birds, a quick tour of the aviaries, and a Panorail ride through the park, after which we viewed the International Bird Show at the amphitheater where trained bird showcased their wares. Some of the more memorable sights at the 20.2-hectare Jurong Birdpark were the Penguin Parade and the Southeast Asian Birds Aviary. With hindsight, the Singapore sojourn turned out to be a truly splendid experience for the group, especially for some of us who tried Singapore's night life for more taste adventure. The thing with Singapore is, it doesn't really matter if you've been there before or not at all. Constantly discovering and ever- changing, Singapore is forever new, and it’s never the same again 1.

                                            MANILA - A regulator has given its final approval to the proposal to develop the Wawa Dam in Rodriguez, Rizal as a new water source for the Metro Manila, the project's proponent said on Monday. WawaJVCO, the joint venture between ports magnate Enrique Razon’s Prime Infra and businessman Oscar Violago’s San Lorenzo Ruiz Builders Group, said the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System approved the Wawa Bulk Water Supply Project during the Nov. 14 meeting of the MWSS Board. The project, which is a private arrangement between Manila Water and WawaJVCo, is expected to generate at least 80 million liters per day (mld) for Manila Water by 2021, and over 500 mld by 2025. Prime Infra said it hoped to break ground on the project next year. MWSS Chairman Reynaldo Velasco said he hoped other government agencies would soon issue permits for the project. Razon first announced the project in April as water service interruptions affected large parts of Metro Manila. The project was initially approved by the MWSS in May, but still had to hurdle a legal review by the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC). The MWSS said the OGCC approved the project last Nov. 7. Wawa Dam used to supply the bulk of Metro Manila's water needs before Angat Dam went into service.　what do your opinion on this matters? ​</a>

umerate on the main objectives
2. Virginia Tool Co. is considering an investment in a B2B system for purchasing office supplies
and non-operating inputs. The project would require an initial investment of $400,000 and
have an expected life of 6 years. The income is expected to be $95,000 in each of the first 4
years and $80,000 in each of the next 2 years. The company's discount rate is 8 percent.
Required:
a. Calculate the payback period.
b. Calculate the NPV on the project.
c. Discuss whether this is acceptable.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>a. Payback period:</strong></p><p></p><p>The payback period is the length of time required to recover the initial investment. To calculate the payback period, we need to determine the cash inflows for each year and add them up until they equal the initial investment of $400,000.</p><p></p><p>Year 1: $95,000</p><p>Year 2: $95,000</p><p>Year 3: $95,000</p><p>Year 4: $95,000</p><p>Year 5: $80,000</p><p>Year 6: $80,000</p><p></p><p>Payback period = 4 + ($120,000 / $80,000) = 5.5 years</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the payback period for the project is 5.5 years.</p><p></p><p><strong>b. Net present value (NPV):</strong></p><p></p><p>The NPV of a project is the difference between the present value of the cash inflows and the present value of the cash outflows. To calculate the NPV of the project, we need to discount each cash flow to its present value and then subtract the initial investment of $400,000.</p><p></p><p>Year 1: $95,000 / (1 + 0.08)^1 = $87,963</p><p>Year 2: $95,000 / (1 + 0.08)^2 = $81,301</p><p>Year 3: $95,000 / (1 + 0.08)^3 = $75,058</p><p>Year 4: $95,000 / (1 + 0.08)^4 = $69,205</p><p>Year 5: $80,000 / (1 + 0.08)^5 = $57,332</p><p>Year 6: $80,000 / (1 + 0.08)^6 = $53,017</p><p></p><p>NPV = ($87,963 + $81,301 + $75,058 + $69,205 + $57,332 + $53,017) - $400,000 = $116,876</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the NPV of the project is $116,876.</p><p></p><p><strong>c. Acceptability:</strong></p><p></p><p>The acceptability of the project depends on the company's criteria for investment decisions. A positive NPV means that the project generates a return greater than the required rate of return, which is 8% in this case. Therefore, the project is acceptable from a financial perspective.</p><p></p><p>However, the payback period is 5.5 years, which may be considered too long for some companies. Additionally, other factors such as the strategic fit with the company's overall goals and the potential risks associated with the project should also be considered before making a final decision.</p><br />

</p><p>in income, wealth and access to basic services and social protection. This necessitates
</p><p>increased investments to strengthen health
</p><p>systems in the subregion and accelerate

</p><p>Short- and long-term measures responding
</p><p>to the needs of vulnerable groups – people

MANILA, Philippines — About P10.2 billion from the Philippine Health Insurance Corp.’s (PhilHealth) budget was “potentially lost” to fraudulent transactions and schemes in 2019. 
This loss could balloon to P18 billion by next year if not addressed properly, PhilHealth president Ricardo Morales revealed on Tuesday during a Senate inquiry on the alleged corruption in the agency. Morales, citing a study in December last year, said the state insurer’s fraud index rate was at 7.5%, while the global average is at 10% to 20%. “In other words, of the 176 billion spent by PhilHealth last year of benefit payments, P10.2 billion was potentially lost to fraud,” he said. “Next year, if the right thing is not done, of the P240 billion planned benefit expenditure, this potential loss could balloon to P18 billion,” the PhilHealth president added. The “systematic” fraud plaguing the agency will only be stemmed by a “robust, integrated, and harmonized information management system” that could run a membership database, Morales claimed. He added that the current information management system of PhilHealth is “fragmented, aging and overextended ministered by overworked IT professionals.” However, the IT project of PhilHealth, which is supposedly designed to stop fraud and scams within the agency, was flagged as “overpriced” by government auditors.</h2><br />

                            15. SINGAPORE SOJOURN by Tammy Mendoza When you're a visitor in this remarkable state, one impression that you will have is that people tend to ask you how many times you've been in Singapore. For the past many years, this Asian dragon has become one of the top tourist draws in Asia. Its vibrant economy has made it arguably the gateway in Southeast Asia, and perhaps, on this account, people have grown quite used to tourists seeing Singapore more often than once. Last September, our group flew to Singapore on the largesse of Singapore Airlines, unquestionably one of the pillars of the impressive success story of the city-state. Cited several times as the best airline by prestigious international magazines, Singapore Airlines is a showcase reliability and finesse. And so is the famed Changi Airport. Also, the object of international distinction, the modern airport has consistently been voted the world’s best, and it proves appropriate, interesting insights of what awaits the Singapore guest. Singapore, like the Changi Airport, is a marvel - the fruit of both foresight and careful orchestration. Despite having a land area of only about 650 square kilometers. Singapore has a thriving economy. It has one of the world’s busiest ports, and is conceded as Asia's business and financial center. Singapore by night is a thrilling sight, as we arrived in the Apollo Hotel, there seemed to be so much to look forward to in this sprightly city of surprise. Our next stop was the Night Safari. Now a popular attraction of Singapore, the Nights Safari was probably our best experiences. It features over 1000 nocturnal creatures which one can see either by tram or trail. Because of the way the park was developed, the creatures can be seen in their natural habitat without wire harnesses. Fittingly, Singapore's Night Safari received the 1995 ASEAN Tourism Association, Award for Excellence as the best New Tourist Attraction in the ASEAN. Next in line was the Sentosa Island. Accessible from certain points by MRT - Singapore Mass Transit System, bus, or cable car. Sentosa Island is a destination in itself. World, Volcanoland, and Cinemania, Images of Singapore, Fantasy Island, Cinemania.After a hearty lunch at Timbua Restaurant, where we had our fill of delectable Indonesian cuisine, we spent the afternoon looking around spent the afternoon looking around Orchard Road, Singapore's shopping paradise. Along the tretch of Orchard Road can be found mall upon quality merchandise for every mold of shopper. After a generous breakfast buffet, we were whisked to the Singapore Science Center. It was here that we viewed a film at Southeast Asians only Omnimax Theater, where images projected on a dome screen gave us the feeling of being engulfed in the picture. Besides the Omninimax Theater, the Singapore Science enter also houses a variety of exhibits on the life science, technology discoveries, and aviation. As for the evening, it belonged to a taxi ride and dinner at Clark's Quay, mainly a cluster of stores by a Singapore river. The highlight of the visit was a taxi ride, where we were taken on a guided tour of the city to better appreciate its history. The following day, the group had splendid time at the Jurong Birdpark which a co-passenger on the taxi ride at Clarks Quay said was his personal choice as the best attraction of Singapore. Here we had breakfast with the birds, a quick tour of the aviaries, and a Panorail ride through the park, after which we viewed the International Bird Show at the amphitheater where trained bird showcased their wares. Some of the more memorable sights at the 20.2-hectare Jurong Birdpark were the Penguin Parade and the Southeast Asian Birds Aviary.

                            18. MANILA - A regulator has given its final approval to the proposal to develop the Wawa Dam in Rodriguez, Rizal as a new water source for the Metro Manila, the project's proponent said on Monday. WawaJVCO, the joint venture between ports magnate Enrique Razon’s Prime Infra and businessman Oscar Violago’s San Lorenzo Ruiz Builders Group, said the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System approved the Wawa Bulk Water Supply Project during the Nov. 14 meeting of the MWSS Board. The project, which is a private arrangement between Manila Water and WawaJVCo, is expected to generate at least 80 million liters per day (mld) for Manila Water by 2021, and over 500 mld by 2025. Prime Infra said it hoped to break ground on the project next year. MWSS Chairman Reynaldo Velasco said he hoped other government agencies would soon issue permits for the project. Razon first announced the project in April as water service interruptions affected large parts of Metro Manila. The project was initially approved by the MWSS in May, but still had to hurdle a legal review by the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC). The MWSS said the OGCC approved the project last Nov. 7. Wawa Dam used to supply the bulk of Metro Manila's water needs before Angat Dam went into service.　what do your opinion on this matters? ​</h2><br />
