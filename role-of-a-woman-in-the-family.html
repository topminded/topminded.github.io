 Women in islam 
A woman, according to Islamic tradition, does not have to give her pre-marriage possessions to her husband and receive a mahr (dower) which she then owns. Furthermore, any earnings that a woman receives through employment or business, after marriage, is hers to keep and need not contribute towards family expenses.There is no singular role or experience for women in Islam. Muslims women hold a variety of positions in society generally, and take on different responsibilities and restrictions in religious settings. They have convened groups for Muslim women and for interfaith dialogue to address how their gender informs their religious experience and how being Muslim affects their lives as American women.</a>

 Women in islam 
A woman, according to Islamic tradition, does not have to give her pre-marriage possessions to her husband and receive a mahr (dower) which she then owns. Furthermore, any earnings that a woman receives through employment or business, after marriage, is hers to keep and need not contribute towards family expenses.There is no singular role or experience for women in Islam. Muslims women hold a variety of positions in society generally, and take on different responsibilities and restrictions in religious settings. They have convened groups for Muslim women and for interfaith dialogue to address how their gender informs their religious experience and how being Muslim affects their lives as American women.</h2><br />
