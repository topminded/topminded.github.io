                        <p> Answer</p><p>Types of Authority</p><p></p><p>The protesters in Tunisia and the civil rights protesters of Martin Luther King, Jr.’s day had influence apart from their position in a government. Their influence came, in part, from their ability to advocate for what many people held as important values. Government leaders might have this kind of influence as well, but they also have the advantage of wielding power associated with their position in the government. As this example indicates, there is more than one type of authority in a community.</p><p></p><p>Authority refers to accepted power—that is, power that people agree to follow. People listen to authority figures because they feel that these individuals are worthy of respect. Generally speaking, people perceive the objectives and demands of an authority figure as reasonable and beneficial, or true.</p><p></p><p>A citizen’s interaction with a police officer is a good example of how people react to authority in everyday life. For instance, a person who sees the flashing red and blue lights of a police car in his rearview mirror usually pulls to the side of the road without hesitation. Such a driver most likely assumes that the police officer behind him serves as a legitimate source of authority and has the right to pull him over. As part of her official duties, the police officer then has the power to issue a speeding ticket if the driver was driving too fast. If the same officer, however, were to command the driver to follow her home and mow her lawn, the driver would likely protest that the officer does not have the authority to make such a request.</p><p></p><p>Not all authority figures are police officers, elected officials or government authorities. Besides formal offices, authority can arise from tradition and personal qualities. Economist and sociologist Max Weber realized this when he examined individual action as it relates to authority, as well as large-scale structures of authority and how they relate to a society’s economy. Based on this work, Weber developed a classification system for authority. His three types of authority are traditional authority, charismatic authority and legal-rational authority (Weber 1922).</p><p> </p><p>Explanation</p><p>I HOPE THAT HELPS :)</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Public trust is an important responsibility that is held by elected and appointed officials in government. Elected officials, such as members of Congress and the President, are chosen by the public through democratic elections, while appointed officials are chosen by elected officials, such as the President. Both types of officials are responsible for serving the public and making decisions that are in the best interest of the country and its citizens.</p><p></p><p>Elected officials are expected to represent the interests of the people who elected them, and to make decisions based on what they believe is in the best interest of their constituents. Appointed officials are expected to carry out the policies and goals of the administration that appointed them, while also being responsive to the needs and concerns of the public.</p><p></p><p>In both cases, public trust is built and maintained through transparency, accountability, and effective communication. Elected and appointed officials should be transparent in their decision-making processes and explain the reasoning behind their decisions to the public. They should also be held accountable for their actions, through mechanisms such as oversight by other branches of government and the media, and be open to criticism and feedback from the public. Good communication with the public and stakeholders, through various means such as town halls, press conferences, and social media, is also key to building and maintaining public trust.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, both elected and appointed officials are expected to be honest, ethical and unbiased in their decision-making, avoiding any kind of conflicts of interest, nepotism, and corruption. They should also be committed to working in the public interest, rather than pursuing their own personal or political interests.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p><strong>First </strong><strong>Thin</strong><strong>g</strong><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>•</strong><strong>•</strong><strong>about </strong><strong>b</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>g</strong><strong> </strong><strong>a </strong><strong>chief </strong><strong>executive </strong><strong>i</strong><strong>s who use this approach believe that their most important job is to create, test, and design the implementation of long-term strategy, extending in some cases into the distant future. Their position overseeing all areas of the corporation, they explain, gives them the unique ability to determine their organizations’ allocation of resources and optimal direction. On a day-to-day basis, they spend their time in activities intended to ascertain their organizations’ point of departure (the current business situation) and point of arrival (the most advantageous market position in the future). These </strong><strong>CHIEF </strong><strong>EXECUTIVE'S </strong><strong>is</strong><strong> devote approximately 80% of their time to matters external to the organization’s operations—customers, competitors, technological advances, and market trends—as opposed to internal matters such as hiring or control systems. It follows, then, that they tend to value employees to whom they can delegate the day-to-day operation of their organizations as well as those who possess finely tuned analytical and planning skills.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Second,</strong></p><p><strong>•</strong><strong>•</strong><strong> </strong><strong>In marked contrast </strong></p><p><strong>to </strong><strong>CHIEF </strong><strong>EXECUTIVE </strong><strong>i</strong><strong>s</strong><strong> in the above group, human-assets </strong><strong>CHIEF </strong><strong>EXECUTIVE'S</strong><strong> strongly believe that strategy formulation belongs close to the markets, in the business units. According to these </strong><strong>CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S</strong><strong> their primary job is to impart to their organizations certain values, behaviors, and attitudes by closely managing the growth and development of individuals. These executives travel constantly, spending the majority of their time in personnel-related activities such as recruiting, performance reviews, and career mapping. Their goal is to create a universe of satellite </strong><strong>CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S</strong><strong> people at every level of the organization who act and make decisions as the </strong><strong>CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S</strong><strong> </strong><strong>would. Not surprisingly, these executives value long-term employees who consistently exhibit “company way” behaviors, as opposed to so-called mavericks, who do not always adhere to organizational norms.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>THIRD</strong></p><p><strong>•</strong><strong>•</strong><strong> The Expertise Approach.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Executives who lead by using this approach believe that the </strong><strong>CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S</strong><strong> </strong><strong>most important responsibility is selecting and disseminating within the corporation an area of expertise that will be a source of competitive advantage. Their schedules show that they devote the majority of their time to activities related to the cultivation and continual improvement of the expertise, such as studying new technological research, analyzing competitors’ products, and meeting with engineers and customers. They often focus on designing programs, systems, and procedures, such as promotion policies and training plans, that reward people who acquire the expertise and share it across the borders of business units and functions. These </strong><strong>CHIEF </strong><strong>EXECUTIVE'S</strong><strong> tend to hire people who are trained in the expertise, but they also seek candidates who possess flexible minds, lack biases, and demonstrate a willingness to be immersed—indoctrinated is not too strong a word—in the expertise.</strong></p><p></p><br />
