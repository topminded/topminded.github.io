                        <strong>These are drugs that people use initially that may eventually lead to abuse of illegal drugs</strong><strong></strong><p>Addiction is a chronic condition defined by compulsive or difficult-to-control substance seeking and use, despite adverse effects. Most people make the decision to use <strong>drugs</strong> voluntarily at first, but chronic <strong>drug</strong> use can cause brain changes that test an addict's self-control and make it difficult to resist strong <strong>drug </strong>cravings. These brain alterations can last a long time, which is why <strong>drug </strong>addiction is referred to as a "relapsing" disease: people in recovery from <strong>drug </strong>use disorders are more likely to relapse after years of abstinence.</p><p>It's typical for people to relapse, but it doesn't indicate treatment isn't effective. Treatment, like that for other chronic illnesses, should be ongoing.</p><p></p><p>These are the drugs that people use initially that may eventually lead to abuse of illegal drugs.​</p><p>brainly.ph/question/9287973</p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><p></p><p></p><br />

District officials decided to narrow the pool by requiring applicants to take the 11th-grade state examination in English. Only about one-quarter of the would-be teachers answered 40 of the 50 multiple-choice questions correctly.</p><p></p><p>As Congress considers reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, teacher education has emerged as a major issue. Many states -- and now President Clinton -- are clamoring to reduce class size, but few are grappling with the most important questions: If we are raising standards for students, don't we also need to raise standards for teachers? Shouldn't state and local officials make sure that teachers know whatever they are supposed to teach students?</p><p></p><p>Almost every state claims that it is strengthening standards for students, but the states have been strangely silent when it comes to ensuring that teachers know what they are supposed to teach. Most instead certify anyone with the right combination of education courses, regardless of their command of the subject they expect to teach, and many states require future teachers to pass only a basic skills test.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
