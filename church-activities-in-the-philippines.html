                        <p>I believe that the most important church activities in the Philippines that should be preserved are those that are essential to the spiritual life of the community and that promote the growth and development of the Catholic faith.</p><p></p><p>One such activity is the celebration of the Eucharist, which is the central rite of the Catholic Church. The Eucharist is a source of nourishment and strength for Catholics, and it provides an opportunity for them to come together as a community to worship and receive the Body and Blood of Christ.</p><p></p><p>Another important church activity is catechesis, or religious education, which is essential to the formation of Catholic beliefs and values. Catechesis provides an opportunity for Catholics to deepen their understanding of the faith and to grow in their relationship with God.</p><p></p><p>The celebration of other sacraments, such as Baptism, Confirmation, and Reconciliation, is also important and should be preserved. These sacraments are essential to the spiritual growth of Catholics and provide a source of grace and strength in their daily lives.</p><p></p><p>Community service and outreach programs are also important church activities that should be preserved. These programs provide an opportunity for Catholics to put their faith into action and to serve those in need, and they help to build a sense of community and solidarity within the Church.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the most important church activities in the Philippines that should be preserved are those that are essential to the spiritual life of the community and that promote the growth and development of the Catholic faith. These activities include the celebration of the Eucharist, catechesis, the celebration of other sacraments, and community service and outreach programs.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Giving the message from God.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>that's important ,so us people know about what is the truth </p><br />

                        Catholic Church's policies  in Population Control and Growth<p></p><p>1. <strong>Find news articles that discuss the Catholic Church's policies</strong> in the Philippines, notably in relation to its role in population control and growth.</p>A review of initiatives promoted or directed by the Catholic church in response to the Philippines' population issue. These initiatives are motivated by the Church's conviction that social and economic justice should come first and that population expansion is connected to development in general. The Catholic Church in the Philippines, to whom 85% of the population belongs, sees it as a problem primarily involving the care of individuals, and instead of focusing on external contraceptive control, it concentrates its efforts on internal human sexual control. In the 1960s, the church started a curriculum called Family Life Education.<p></p><p>2. <strong>Based on the news reports gathered, explain your position</strong> on the Catholic Church's contribution to reproductive health and the population increase in the Philippines.</p><p></p>The majority-Catholic nation also boasts one of Asia's fastest-growing populations and a sizable amount of chronic poverty. The Philippines has lagged behind as its neighbors have progressed faster.The church disagrees with economists who claim that rapid population expansion is a major contributing element. It asserts that people need work, not contraceptives, and that population growth is not a contributing factor to poverty.<p>3. <strong>Describe one key insight you have gained from this class.</strong></p><p></p>Only if fertility rates decline in a way that causes the young-age population to expand more slowly than the total workforce will the demographic window become available. Due to the Catholic hierarchy's extreme stance, the state is unable to address the problem effectively.<p></p><p></p><p>4. <strong>Think about how the following will benefit from your newfound knowledge:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>a. your nation</strong></p>Our government must address the issue of reproductive health, and we must all work together to support our nation in doing so. We must completely abide by the law if we want to protect ourselves.<p></p><p><strong>b. your neighborhood</strong></p>By protecting ourselves with contraceptives, attending family planning classes, and taking care of other associated reproductive health issues, we should also support our barangay.<p></p><p><strong>c. your school</strong></p>We should be familiar with the fundamental facts about population increase, sexual health, and the many viewpoints and ideologies of the teachers and students in our school.<p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>d. one's family</strong></p>Parents that are well-informed can do a lot for their kids. We can stop overpopulation and poverty if both the mother and father are educated. The family is the foundation of everything.<p></p><p>Period of catholic church:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/3274857</p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />
