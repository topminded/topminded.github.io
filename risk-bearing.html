Often times, the activities under the banner of entrepreneurship requires a high amount of hard work and persistence, and endeavor is one thing or character that must be possessed by the entrepreneur in order for his or her business to proceed and achieve success.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, <strong>profit </strong>itself is one of the main goals in <strong>entrepreneurship</strong>. Profit should also be put into priority, however I think in practice it is extremely hard, especially considering that in entrepreneurship, it is highly important to take into considerations other things such as operational fee, the employees' salary, as well as the overall balance of the company.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, <strong>entrepreneur </strong>is the person who is trying to establish entrepreneurship. An entrepreneur often times has certain characteristics that other people from other jobs do not. This might include persistence, hardworking, etc.</p><p></p><p>Lastly,<strong> risk bearing</strong> is a consequence that every entrepreneur must understand. We can't avoid risk at all cost, and so it results in bearing the risk in the end. However, we can always calculate things so that it won't result in a bigger risk than it already is.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about <strong>the topic of entrepreneurship </strong>by referring to https://brainly.ph/question/24622577</p><p>#SPJ2</p><p></p><br />

                            30. How can STS helps us think about responsible design practices for technologies that bear some amount of risk?</h2><br />
                        <p>STS (Science and Technology Studies) can help us think about responsible design practices for technologies that bear some amount of risk by providing a framework for understanding the social and cultural context in which technologies are developed, implemented, and used.</p><p></p><p>One key concept in STS is the idea of "co-production," which suggests that technology and society are mutually shaping and influencing each other. This means that technologies are not neutral or objective, but rather reflect the values, assumptions, and interests of the people who create and use them. Therefore, responsible design practices must take into account not only technical considerations, but also ethical, social, and political concerns.</p><p></p><p>Another important concept in STS is the idea of "sociotechnical imaginaries," which refers to the shared visions, values, and aspirations that shape the development and use of technologies. Responsible design practices should take into account the sociotechnical imaginaries that underpin the technologies they are designing, and should strive to align these imaginaries with broader societal goals and values.</p><p></p><p>STS also emphasizes the importance of engaging with diverse stakeholders in the design process, including users, communities, and other relevant actors. By involving these stakeholders in the design process, designers can gain a more nuanced understanding of the social and cultural factors that may affect the technology's use and impact, and can work to address any potential risks or negative consequences.</p><p></p><p>Overall, by applying STS frameworks and concepts to the design of technologies that bear some amount of risk, designers can develop more responsible and socially conscious practices that take into account the complex social and cultural contexts in which technologies are situated.</p><p></p><br />
