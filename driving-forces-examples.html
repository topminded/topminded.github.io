Newton's Third Law of Motion 1 Newton's third law of motion states that whatever an object exerts a second object, the second object exerts and opposite force on the first object. Third law of motion is on a 2. an known as law of 3. and 4. Every force exerted is accompanied by an 5. and equal force. Based on this law, in every 6. the forces always occur in 7 These forces act at the same 8. equal and opposite. Even though these action and reaction forces are equal and oppo- site in direction, they don't 9 each other because they are act- ing on different objects. For example, the interaction between the tires and the road while a man drives. The tires push on the road while the road pushes on the tires. Another ex- ample is when a swimmer pushes the water 10. the water pushes the swimmer forward. 5​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Curiosity and curiosity-driven questioning are important for developing scientific thinking and more general interest and motivation to pursue scientific questions.</p><p>2. Scientists will alter hypotheses and theories when new knowledge is developed. Objectivity is important in science because scientific studies seek to get as close to the truth as possible, not just prove a hypothesis. Experiments should be designed to be objective and not to get the answers that a scientists wants.</p><p>3. Every failed experiment confers changes to the researcher's perspective. As such, the researcher is able to hone his skills and become better at researching. Failure also helps to change the experimental design by showing researchers what works.</p><p>4. To show your reader you've done proper research by listing sources you used to get your information. To be a responsible scholar by giving credit to other researchers and acknowledging their ideas. To avoid plagiarism by quoting words and ideas used by other authors.</p><p>5. The quote is attributed to Thomas Edison in an article in Harper's Magazine.

On Friday the 13th the car you are driving runs out of gas. Is it bad luck? Probably not. First you try to push the car with you friends in it to the closest gas station. But you find that doesn’t work. Using examples from the lessons learned (Newton’s Laws of Motion and how forces work) devise a plan to get the car to the next gas station. </h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Intellectual capital is the result of mental processes that form a set of intangible objects that can be used in economic activity and bring income to its owner[1] (organization), covering the competencies of its people (human capital), the value relating to its relationships (relational capital), and everything that is left when the employees go home[2] (structural capital), of which intellectual property (IP) is but one component.[3] It is the sum of everything everybody in a company knows that gives it a competitive edge.[4] The term is used in academia in an attempt to account for the value of intangible assets not listed explicitly on a company's balance sheets.[5] However, what managers understand as intellectual capital within their organizations is not always that evident [6] On a national level intellectual capital refers to national intangible capital (NIC).[7]</p><p>A second meaning that is used in academia and was adopted in large corporations is focused on the recycling of knowledge via knowledge management and intellectual capital management (ICM).[8][9][10] Creating, shaping and updating the stock of intellectual capital requires the formulation of a strategic vision, which blends together all three dimensions of intellectual capital within the organisational context through exploration, exploitation, measurement, and disclosure.[11] Intellectual capital is used in the context of assessing the wealth of organizations.[12] A metric for the value of intellectual capital is the amount by which the enterprise value of a firm exceeds the value of its tangible (physical and financial) assets.[13][14] Directly visible on corporate books is capital embodied in its physical assets and financial capital; however all three make up the value of an enterprise.[15] Measuring the real value and the total performance of intellectual capital's components is a critical part of running a company in the knowledge economy and Information Age. Understanding the intellectual capital in an enterprise allows leveraging of its intellectual assets.[16] For a corporation, the result will optimize its stock price.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>An important study on human intellectual capital development in the Philippines has recently been completed at the Brookings Institution, Washington DC.

                            30. ad carefully the paragraph below. Fill the missing blanks of word found inside the box. Newton's Third Law of Motion 1 Newton's third law of motion states that whatever an object exerts a second object, the second object exerts and opposite force on the first object. Third law of motion is on a 2. an known as law of 3. and 4. Every force exerted is accompanied by an 5. and equal force. Based on this law, in every 6. the forces always occur in 7 These forces act at the same 8. equal and opposite. Even though these action and reaction forces are equal and oppo- site in direction, they don't 9 each other because they are act- ing on different objects. For example, the interaction between the tires and the road while a man drives. The tires push on the road while the road pushes on the tires. Another ex- ample is when a swimmer pushes the water 10. the water pushes the swimmer forward. 5​</h2><br />
