                                            ACTIVITY #2. Identify in which section of the research paper each of these extracts is likely to appear and write it beside the extract. Use the 12 section names that were referred to in ACTIVITY#1. You don't need to try to understand the exact content of each extract. Just look for clues that help you find the answer.1.As youths look for sources of information, emotional understanding and cues for the expression of their emerging social and personal identity, they often find music to provide them with valuable meanings (Zillman and Gan, 1987). 2. In this paper, we explore the characteristics of teen pop lyrics and their significance at the personal and sociocultural level.3.In our analysis, we included all the artists featured on the Disney Channel Network (hereafter, DCN) during the third week of December 2000 in order to draw a broad sample of contemporary teen pop performers. We chose the DCN because it is one of only two TV cable channels whose programming is dedicated TIV exclusively to pre-adolescents and adolescents. Whereas the label 'rock' has often been used as an umbrella term to catch just about any genre other than classical, one particular style that has been largely ignored by academic observers is teen pop. The influence of teen pop in pre-adolescent and adolescent.4.culture can no longer be ignored given its increasingly dominant role in music sales, TV and radio airplay, the proliferation of popular female performers and all-boy bands, and the integration of individual teen pop stars into advertising campaigns by Fortune 500 corporations (e.g., Burger King, McDonald's, PepsiCo, Inc.).5. While reading these lyrics, we encountered numerous stories of obsessive thinking, potent feelings of attachment, and mentions of much emotional and physical support received and offered through care and sex that seem to guarantee these lovers vital stimulation and freedom. In short, dependence on love seems to be a form of perceived self-insufficiency, a feeling that one cannot bear one's existence by oneself. Teen pop music writers and performers narrate vividly the details of these feelings of insufficiency.​pasagot po thanks</a>

When mice are kept at high population densities, their behavior changes in anumber of ways. Aggressive activity within populations of mice rises as density increases.Cannibalism of young also goes up, and so does aberrant sexual activity. Communalnesting, frequent in natural mouse populations, increases abnormally. In one example, 58mice one to three days old (from several litters) were found in one nest, most unusualcommunal living. None survived because most of the mothers deserted them immediatelyafter birth.4. There are three different types of rock music, alternative rock, classic rock, andhard rock, also known as metal. Alternative rock features a steady bass drum laying downthe beat, with easy flowing guitar riffs over the top. The bass line is toned town, and thelyrics are sung with intensity an authority. Depending on the song, the guitars can either beacoustic guitars or electric guitars. Classic rock combines a steady driving bass drum sound,with high snare overtones, steady and often repeating guitar riffs, and an intensive bass line.The guitars are more often than not all electric guitars, and distortion is rarely used. Thelyrics are sung with style and enthusiasm. Hard rock, or metal, features a hard rolling bassdrum with an abundant amount of cymbal work. This style of rock uses several electricguitars with heavy distortion to bring a very intense sound. A hard, intense, driving bass linerounds out the style. The lyrics aren't really sung so much as screamed. It doesn't matterwhat your preference is, each different style of rock music is unique on its own.5. The moon is our closest neighbor.

In addition, there is no atmosphere on the moon. The footprints left byastronauts back in 1969 are still there, as crisply formed as they were on the day they weremade. The lack of atmosphere also means there is no water in the moon, an importantproblem when travelling there.with the closest meaning,  ​</a>

Use the 12 section names that were referred to in ACTIVITY#1. You don't need to try to understand the exact content of each extract. Just look for clues that help you find the answer.1.As youths look for sources of information, emotional understanding and cues for the expression of their emerging social and personal identity, they often find music to provide them with valuable meanings (Zillman and Gan, 1987). 2. In this paper, we explore the characteristics of teen pop lyrics and their significance at the personal and sociocultural level.3.In our analysis, we included all the artists featured on the Disney Channel Network (hereafter, DCN) during the third week of December 2000 in order to draw a broad sample of contemporary teen pop performers. We chose the DCN because it is one of only two TV cable channels whose programming is dedicated TIV exclusively to pre-adolescents and adolescents. Whereas the label 'rock' has often been used as an umbrella term to catch just about any genre other than classical, one particular style that has been largely ignored by academic observers is teen pop. The influence of teen pop in pre-adolescent and adolescent.4.culture can no longer be ignored given its increasingly dominant role in music sales, TV and radio airplay, the proliferation of popular female performers and all-boy bands, and the integration of individual teen pop stars into advertising campaigns by Fortune 500 corporations (e.g., Burger King, McDonald's, PepsiCo, Inc.).5. While reading these lyrics, we encountered numerous stories of obsessive thinking, potent feelings of attachment, and mentions of much emotional and physical support received and offered through care and sex that seem to guarantee these lovers vital stimulation and freedom. In short, dependence on love seems to be a form of perceived self-insufficiency, a feeling that one cannot bear one's existence by oneself. Teen pop music writers and performers narrate vividly the details of these feelings of insufficiency.​pasagot po thanks</h2><br />
