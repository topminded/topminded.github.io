It is only in this light that the real definition of obscenity should be made."- F. Slonil José, Ermita A Filipino Novel Emotion: 3. "Sometimes it pays not to be interested in what happened but in what did not happen.'-Ambeth Ocampo, Rizal Without the Overcoat Emotion: 4.

It is the poverty which is obscene, and the criminal irresponsibility of the leaders who make this poverty a deadening reality. The obscenities in this country are the places of the rich, the new hotels made at the expense of the people, the hospitals where the poor die when they get sick because they don't have the money either for medicines or services. It is only in this light that the real definition of obscenity should be made."- F. Slonil José, Ermita A Filipino Novel Emotion: 3. "Sometimes it pays not to be interested in what happened but in what did not happen.'-Ambeth Ocampo, Rizal Without the Overcoat Emotion: 4.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>“Ang kabataan ang pag-asa ng bayan”, these were the words said by the National Filipino Hero Jose Rizal. During his lifetime, he was devoted to the belief that what would make a country prosper are its own children. His beliefs may have been caused by the great show of bravery and courage in the Filipino youth of his time. He believed that the future will be better sooner or later. But has he expected too much? Decades have pass since his time and we can say that the Philippines has improved but to what extent? Yes, children of the past have indeed grown up and become great people in our country. As the years go by, a new generation of Filipinos has emerged. Sadly, with time comes change. </p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>Without a doubt, the youth indeed is the hope of the fatherland! </p><p></p><p>If we try to look back at the life of the Filipinos during the Spanish era, we will better understand the reasons why Dr. Jose Rizal has so much hope for the youth and regarded them as the hope of the nation or of the Fatherland. </p><p></p><p>We may ask, why is the "hope" or the responsibility to raise our nation from the ashes of ruins and despondency was passed down to the youth? Can't the revolutionaries bring back the glory and honor of the nation? Is Aguinaldo's government prove to be insignificant and useless in our fatherland's century-old yearning for freedom and independence? </p><p></p><p>Not at all.</p><p>While Rizal's generation offered their lives for the emancipation of our nation from the filthy chains of the Spanish rule, the hope to further liberate our fatherland from the menace of ignorance, tryranny, division, greed, and all forms of immorality are passed down to the youth because the survival of our race, the preservation and the protection of our culture, the glory and honor of our nation, and the brightness of our future belongs to them. </p><p></p><p>The youth will be the future leaders of their generations, if they fail to be good and competent leaders, their generation will surely suffer from their incompetence. </p><p></p><p>But this endeavor will only be attained unless the youth realize the value of education as the primary means to achieve their vission. </p><p></p><p>That is why Rizal put great emphasis on the education of the youth, becasue  without education, it is possible that the youth will only repeat history itself. </p><p></p><p>For further readings, click this: https://brainly.ph/question/14118377</p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST</p><br />
