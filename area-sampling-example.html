Magnetic Particle Test can be performed by wet method, which uses finely divided dry particles that are dusted onto a magnetized surface, is better for rough surfaces. _2. X-rays and Gamma rays are examples of Penetrate Test. 3. A fluorescent penetrant test requires an ultraviolet light (black light) to observe the test results. It may be necessary to enclose the viewing area to properly read the test results. -4. The major advantage of ultrasonic testing is the advanced skill required to properly interpret the results. Weld design, location of the defect, internal structure, and complexity of the weldment affect the interpretation of the ultrasonic signal. 5. Visual testing equipment includes rulers, fillet weld gauges, squares, magnifying glasses, and reference weld samples.pakisagot ng maayus please ​</a>

an exposed soil resources. (Example: backyard, garden, vacant lot)
2. Locate a small area where you can get a soil sample. Using a stick, try to lose the
particles of the soil to see the components and easily get sample as well.
3. Get a handful sample of the soil and place it in a clear plastic bag or in a sheet of
paper.
4. Continue examining the soil sample at home such as its color, texture and
components.
5. Take a picture of your soil sample.
6. Answer the questions that follow.
Questions:
1. What makes up soil based on your observation? __________________________________

2. How do you think soil is being formed? ___________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________________
3. Give the characteristics of the soil that you have examined.

Why did you say so? ________________________________________________________________</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1. what makes up a soil based on your observation?<p>From my observation soil is made from dried/dead leaves and old rocks that has been crushed and other organic materials.</p><p></p>2. How do you think soil is being formed?<p>When a rock has been sitting on the ground for so long, some bacterias tend to colonized the rock and after a few days the rock will be automatically crack and a new plant will be born between the cracks of the rock.</p><p></p> 3. Give the characteristics of the soil that you have examined<p>color: Dark brown</p><p>texture: soft</p><p></p>4. What types of soil do you know?<p>There are 6 types of soil but I only know 4 of them but here are the 6 type of soil such as <strong>clay </strong><strong>soil,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>sandy </strong><strong>soil,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>silty </strong><strong>soil,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>peaty </strong><strong>soil,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>chalky </strong><strong>soil,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>loamy </strong><strong>soil.</strong></p><p></p>5. What type of soil do you think your soil sample is? Why did you say so?<p>The type of soil that I examined is loamy soil because loamy soil have dark color and soft texture it's a bit wet too and I'm confident to say that the soil I examined is a loamy soil. </p><br />
