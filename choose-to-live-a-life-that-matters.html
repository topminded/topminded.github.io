                                            Let Us practiceActivity 1: Biotic Living with Abiotic FactorsYou have learned that abiotic factors, also called abiotic components,are non-living factors that impact an ecosystem and the associated livingthings. The term "abiotic" comes from the root parts "a- meaning "without",and "bio", meaning "life". Abiotic factors include wind, sunlight, soil, water,atmosphere, and temperature.There are many different types of environments, such as deserts,forests, grasslands, tundra, ocean beaches, and of course, estuaries(connection of fresh and saltwater). Each type of environment containsmany different factors that interact with each other. For instance, a forestenvironment has large trees with smaller bushes, some grasses, rivers,ponds, insects, many different types of small and large animals, soil withorganic matter in it, and usually abundant rainfall. In contrast, a desertenvironment has cactus, small plants, lizards, snakes, smaller animals,sandy and or rocky soil, and low yearly rainfall.The way all of the factors in an environment interact determineswhich organisms can live in that environment. For instance, an alligator,which needs a lot of water to live in, would have a hard time living in adesert that doesn't have much water. Ferns need shade and moist soil to liveand would die in the hot, dry, sunny desert. Polar bears have thick fur coatsto keep warm in the cold, snowy arctic and would have a difficult time ifthey lived in a hot, humid tropical environment.Questions:1. What do we mean when we talk about an "environment?" In yournotebook, write down all of the things that comes to mind when youthink of an "environment".2. From the text above, choose one type of environment and describe it.Also, identify the biotic and abiotic factors that are present in thatenvironment.Paki answer po thank you po in advance ​</a>

                                            Read the paragraph below and answer the questions that follow.
The western world is in love with the concept of freedom. It is the most precious aspect of society. Whether it is the freedom of religion or speech, the freedom to choose our political leaders, or to pursue the life we choose without fear of interference from individuals or governments, freedom is essential and paramount in all things.
However, when we move from our societal craving for freedom to our personal lives, or the workplace, we seem ready to give up our freedom and are willing to put our happiness and our level of motivation in the hands of someone else. In the workplace we call this someone else "management". It becomes management's job to give us rewarding work, to motivate us, to make us into high-performing individuals and teams. We tell ourselves that our mechanical systems of rewards and punishments, measurements, strategies, or command and control structures get the behaviors that we want from our organizations. In short, we create these devices to help eliminate the need for the exercise of free will.
Koestenbaum and Block suggest that this "escape from freedom," as Erich Fromm called it, is in large part due to the fact that "...with freedom comes accountability, and with accountability comes guilt, and with guilt comes anxiety.
But this creates an interesting paradox. By allowing others to choose I have made a choice. I have chosen to give others the power to choose for me, which in itself is an exercise of my free will. Therefore, I am still accountable, at least to myself, for the results of my decision.
Arguments are sure to be put forward showing how, at least in certain circumstances, I had no choice in the matter: "I hate this job, but if I don't come to work I will be fired. I have no choice but to come to work." Or, "The law says I have to pay my taxes. I have no choice. If I don't pay my taxes I will go to jail."
When these statements are examined more closely we see that there is an element of choice in each. I choose to continue to go work at a job that I hate because I am unwilling to deal with the consequences of walking away from the job. Instead of choosing to look for another job, I choose to continue working at the one I have. I am accountable for my choice to continue in an unpleasant job instead of changing my situation. I choose to pay my taxes because I am not willing to be accountable for the consequences related to not paying my taxes. Regardless of why I made the choice to pay my taxes, it is still my choice to make the payment.
We are not always in control of the alternatives among which we may choose. Having free will does not imply that life will always be perfect, or that the choice of another option would have provided us with great happiness. But through the exercise of our free will we are able to embrace our humanity, and to take on the succession of risks that life has to offer.
Recognizing that we are free gives us the ability to exercise control over our existence, and lets us shift from blaming others for how things are to being accountable for our life. "Once the
 inevitability [that we are accountable] is recognized, we will be inclined to place the full blame [or credit] on ourselves rather than on others or on objective situations beyond our control." (Freedom And Accountability At Work, Koestenbaum and Block, 2001, P. 79)
The good news is that you have free will, and that opens up a world of opportunity. The bad news is that you have free will, and that opens up a world of accountability.
1. How are Freedom and Accountability related to each other? Explain clearly and comprehensively.

                            19. Let Us practiceActivity 1: Biotic Living with Abiotic FactorsYou have learned that abiotic factors, also called abiotic components,are non-living factors that impact an ecosystem and the associated livingthings. The term "abiotic" comes from the root parts "a- meaning "without",and "bio", meaning "life". Abiotic factors include wind, sunlight, soil, water,atmosphere, and temperature.There are many different types of environments, such as deserts,forests, grasslands, tundra, ocean beaches, and of course, estuaries(connection of fresh and saltwater). Each type of environment containsmany different factors that interact with each other. For instance, a forestenvironment has large trees with smaller bushes, some grasses, rivers,ponds, insects, many different types of small and large animals, soil withorganic matter in it, and usually abundant rainfall. In contrast, a desertenvironment has cactus, small plants, lizards, snakes, smaller animals,sandy and or rocky soil, and low yearly rainfall.The way all of the factors in an environment interact determineswhich organisms can live in that environment. For instance, an alligator,which needs a lot of water to live in, would have a hard time living in adesert that doesn't have much water. Ferns need shade and moist soil to liveand would die in the hot, dry, sunny desert. Polar bears have thick fur coatsto keep warm in the cold, snowy arctic and would have a difficult time ifthey lived in a hot, humid tropical environment.Questions:1. What do we mean when we talk about an "environment?" In yournotebook, write down all of the things that comes to mind when youthink of an "environment".2. From the text above, choose one type of environment and describe it.Also, identify the biotic and abiotic factors that are present in thatenvironment.Paki answer po thank you po in advance ​</h2><br />

                            29. Read the paragraph below and answer the questions that follow.
The western world is in love with the concept of freedom. It is the most precious aspect of society. Whether it is the freedom of religion or speech, the freedom to choose our political leaders, or to pursue the life we choose without fear of interference from individuals or governments, freedom is essential and paramount in all things.
However, when we move from our societal craving for freedom to our personal lives, or the workplace, we seem ready to give up our freedom and are willing to put our happiness and our level of motivation in the hands of someone else. In the workplace we call this someone else "management". It becomes management's job to give us rewarding work, to motivate us, to make us into high-performing individuals and teams. We tell ourselves that our mechanical systems of rewards and punishments, measurements, strategies, or command and control structures get the behaviors that we want from our organizations. In short, we create these devices to help eliminate the need for the exercise of free will.
Koestenbaum and Block suggest that this "escape from freedom," as Erich Fromm called it, is in large part due to the fact that "...with freedom comes accountability, and with accountability comes guilt, and with guilt comes anxiety.
But this creates an interesting paradox. By allowing others to choose I have made a choice. I have chosen to give others the power to choose for me, which in itself is an exercise of my free will. Therefore, I am still accountable, at least to myself, for the results of my decision.
Arguments are sure to be put forward showing how, at least in certain circumstances, I had no choice in the matter: "I hate this job, but if I don't come to work I will be fired. I have no choice but to come to work." Or, "The law says I have to pay my taxes. I have no choice. If I don't pay my taxes I will go to jail."
When these statements are examined more closely we see that there is an element of choice in each. I choose to continue to go work at a job that I hate because I am unwilling to deal with the consequences of walking away from the job. Instead of choosing to look for another job, I choose to continue working at the one I have. I am accountable for my choice to continue in an unpleasant job instead of changing my situation. I choose to pay my taxes because I am not willing to be accountable for the consequences related to not paying my taxes. Regardless of why I made the choice to pay my taxes, it is still my choice to make the payment.
We are not always in control of the alternatives among which we may choose. Having free will does not imply that life will always be perfect, or that the choice of another option would have provided us with great happiness. But through the exercise of our free will we are able to embrace our humanity, and to take on the succession of risks that life has to offer.
Recognizing that we are free gives us the ability to exercise control over our existence, and lets us shift from blaming others for how things are to being accountable for our life. "Once the
 inevitability [that we are accountable] is recognized, we will be inclined to place the full blame [or credit] on ourselves rather than on others or on objective situations beyond our control." (Freedom And Accountability At Work, Koestenbaum and Block, 2001, P. 79)
The good news is that you have free will, and that opens up a world of opportunity. The bad news is that you have free will, and that opens up a world of accountability.
1. How are Freedom and Accountability related to each other? Explain clearly and comprehensively.
