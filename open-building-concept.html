A structure found in the nucleus that helps produce ribosomes. It is a thin layer around the cell but not a rigid one. It has openings to allow transportation and exchange of materials. When a cell needs energy, it brings in nutrients and break it down and supply energy to the cell. Cell storage. It helps produce food for plants and absorbs light energy from the sun and use it to convert C02 and H20 into sugar and oxygen. It is the digestive system in an animal cell because it contains enzymes that break down wastes and other materials. These build proteins in the cell and can be found in several places in the cells which includes in the cytosol and on the endoplasmic reticulum. They do the DNA synthesis and direct the genetic information of the cell. These are made of DNA and found in the nucleus and usually in pairs. Brain of the cell. An organelle that serves as the transport system. It is only found in the plant cells that support the plat which is also made of specialized sugar called cellulose. It gathers molecules and make them more complex. It also stores them or send them into the cytosol or out of the cell. This organelle also processes the proteins produced by the endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes. It does not contain cell wall. An organism made up of one cell. Organism composed of many cells An organism that lacks nucleus An organism with true nucleus.​</a>

When a cell needs energy, it brings in nutrients and break it down and supply energy to the cell. Cell storage. It helps produce food for plants and absorbs light energy from the sun and use it to convert C02 and H20 into sugar and oxygen. It is the digestive system in an animal cell because it contains enzymes that break down wastes and other materials. These build proteins in the cell and can be found in several places in the cells which includes in the cytosol and on the endoplasmic reticulum.
