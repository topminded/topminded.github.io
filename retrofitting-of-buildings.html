                            8. Activity 5: Think-and-Write: Hypotheses Read the statements below carefully. Give at least two (2) possible hypotheses for each item. 1. Imagine that an earthquake has hit your town, causing a downtown building to collapse. Describe the destruction process, starting with the initial tremor and its resulting waves and ending with the collapse of the building. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________2. Discuss the ways in which people can work together to make sure that their neighborhood is as safe as possible in the event of an earthquake.______________________________________________________________________________________________________ 3. Despite to modern technology and construction capabilities, many structures in the world's earthquake-risk zones have not been retrofitted (to provide with new parts that were not available when it was originally built).______________________________________________________________________________________________________​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Hypothesis 1:</p><p>Initial tremors cause the ground to shake, creating waves that propagate through the building's foundation. The waves cause the building's structure to vibrate, leading to cracks in the foundation and walls. Over time, the vibrations increase, causing the building's foundation and walls to weaken until they can no longer support the weight of the structure, leading to the building's eventual collapse.</p><p>Hypothesis 2:</p><p>The initial tremors from the earthquake create waves that propagate through the building's foundation, leading to localized damage to the foundation and walls. As the earthquake continues, the waves become more intense, leading to progressive damage to the building's structure. The building's structural integrity is eventually compromised, leading to its collapse.</p><p></p><p>Hypothesis 1:</p><p>Neighbors can work together to identify potential hazards in the area and take measures to mitigate them, such as securing furniture and appliances and retrofitting buildings to make them earthquake-resistant. They can also establish emergency plans and practice drills to ensure that everyone knows what to do in the event of an earthquake.</p><p>Hypothesis 2:</p><p>Neighbors can work together to ensure that everyone in the community is educated on earthquake safety, including the proper way to react during an earthquake and the steps to take in the aftermath. They can also coordinate with local emergency services to establish a community response plan and to receive training on how to use emergency equipment.</p><p></p><p>Hypothesis 1:</p><p>Structures in earthquake-risk zones have not been retrofitted due to lack of funding, resources, or knowledge about the potential risks of earthquakes. Some building owners may also believe that retrofitting is too expensive or not worth the investment.</p><p>Hypothesis 2:</p><p>Building codes and regulations in earthquake-risk zones may not require retrofits, leading to a lack of incentive for building owners to retrofit their structures. Additionally, some building owners may be reluctant to undertake retrofitting projects due to concerns about the disruption to their business or the inconvenience to their tenants.</p><br />

The spelling 'fibre' is typically used outside the US. CFRPs can be expensive to produce, but are commonly used wherever high strength-to-weight ratio and stiffness (rigidity) are required, such as aerospace, superstructures of ships, automotive, civil engineering, sports equipment, and an increasing number of consumer and technical applications.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
