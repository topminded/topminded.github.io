 Last year, the Girl Scouts in our district celebrated their anniversary with a j̲o̲u̲r̲n̲e̲y̲. 
 (What do you think is the meaning of journey?) The purpose of this trip was to explore the virgin 
 forests of Palawan, since the forests of Palawan have not yet been touched by loggers. Many of 
 the Girl Scouts who went were i̲n̲d̲e̲p̲e̲n̲d̲e̲n̲t̲ girls. (What do you think is the meaning of 
 independent?) and did not need help in doing basic or e̲s̲s̲e̲n̲t̲i̲a̲l̲ things like cooking and hiking. 
 (What do you think is the meaning of essential?)
 Learning the meaning of c̲o̲o̲p̲e̲r̲a̲t̲i̲o̲n̲ helped to make their trip a success. (Guess the
 meaning of cooperation.) By working together well, most of them learned much and enjoy the 
 trip. They learned the value of p̲r̲e̲s̲e̲r̲v̲i̲n̲g̲ or taking good care of our forests to avoid floods and 
 soil erosion. (What is the meaning of preserving?)

The Secret Garden
 When Mary Lennox was sent to live with her uncle, everybody said she was the most d̲i̲s̲a̲g̲r̲e̲e̲a̲b̲l̲e̲-̲l̲o̲o̲k̲i̲n̲g̲ child ever seen. She had a little thin face and a little thin body, thin light hair and a sour e̲x̲p̲r̲e̲s̲s̲i̲o̲n̲. Her hair was yellow, and her face was yellow because she had been born in India. She had always been i̲l̲l̲ in one way or another.
 Her father had held a p̲o̲s̲i̲t̲i̲o̲n̲ under the English government. He had always been busy and ill himself. Her mother had been a great beauty to cared only to go to parties and a̲m̲u̲s̲e̲ herself. She had not wanted a little girl at all, and when Mary was born, she ̲h̲a̲n̲d̲e̲d̲ her over to the care of an A̲y̲a̲h̲.
 She never remembered seeing f̲a̲m̲i̲l̲i̲a̲r̲l̲y̲ anything but the faces of her Ayah and the other native servants. They always obeyed her and gave her own way in everything. By the time she was six years old she was as t̲y̲r̲a̲n̲n̲i̲c̲a̲l̲ and selfish a little girl as ever lived.
 The young English g̲o̲v̲e̲r̲n̲e̲s̲s̲ who came to teach her to read and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months. When another governess came, they always went away in a shorter time than the first one. So, if Mary had not chosen to learn how to read books, she would never have learned her letters at all.

 Last year, the Girl Scouts in our district celebrated their anniversary with a j̲o̲u̲r̲n̲e̲y̲. 
 (What do you think is the meaning of journey?) The purpose of this trip was to explore the virgin 
 forests of Palawan, since the forests of Palawan have not yet been touched by loggers. Many of 
 the Girl Scouts who went were i̲n̲d̲e̲p̲e̲n̲d̲e̲n̲t̲ girls. (What do you think is the meaning of 
 independent?) and did not need help in doing basic or e̲s̲s̲e̲n̲t̲i̲a̲l̲ things like cooking and hiking. 
 (What do you think is the meaning of essential?)
 Learning the meaning of c̲o̲o̲p̲e̲r̲a̲t̲i̲o̲n̲ helped to make their trip a success. (Guess the
 meaning of cooperation.) By working together well, most of them learned much and enjoy the 
 trip. They learned the value of p̲r̲e̲s̲e̲r̲v̲i̲n̲g̲ or taking good care of our forests to avoid floods and 
 soil erosion. (What is the meaning of preserving?)

The Secret Garden
 When Mary Lennox was sent to live with her uncle, everybody said she was the most d̲i̲s̲a̲g̲r̲e̲e̲a̲b̲l̲e̲-̲l̲o̲o̲k̲i̲n̲g̲ child ever seen. She had a little thin face and a little thin body, thin light hair and a sour e̲x̲p̲r̲e̲s̲s̲i̲o̲n̲. Her hair was yellow, and her face was yellow because she had been born in India. She had always been i̲l̲l̲ in one way or another.
 Her father had held a p̲o̲s̲i̲t̲i̲o̲n̲ under the English government. He had always been busy and ill himself. Her mother had been a great beauty to cared only to go to parties and a̲m̲u̲s̲e̲ herself. She had not wanted a little girl at all, and when Mary was born, she ̲h̲a̲n̲d̲e̲d̲ her over to the care of an A̲y̲a̲h̲.
 She never remembered seeing f̲a̲m̲i̲l̲i̲a̲r̲l̲y̲ anything but the faces of her Ayah and the other native servants. They always obeyed her and gave her own way in everything. By the time she was six years old she was as t̲y̲r̲a̲n̲n̲i̲c̲a̲l̲ and selfish a little girl as ever lived.
 The young English g̲o̲v̲e̲r̲n̲e̲s̲s̲ who came to teach her to read and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months. When another governess came, they always went away in a shorter time than the first one. So, if Mary had not chosen to learn how to read books, she would never have learned her letters at all.
