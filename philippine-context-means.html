Questions.
1. In the Philippine context, what is obligation? 
2. Why is obligation a juridical necessity?
3. What does “to do” or “not to do” means in the obligation? Expound your answer by providing atleast an example or illustration.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. In the Philippine context, obligation refers to a legal or moral duty that one is bound to fulfill or comply with. It is a requirement or responsibility that is imposed on an individual or entity to perform a certain act, whether it be an action or omission, based on a legal or moral relationship with another party.</p><p></p><p>2. Obligation is considered a juridical necessity because it is enforceable by law. In the Philippines, obligations arise from various sources such as contracts, laws, customs, and moral norms. When an obligation is recognized by law, it means that there are legal consequences for failing to fulfill that obligation. The aggrieved party may seek legal remedies, such as filing a lawsuit or seeking damages, to enforce the obligation and hold the defaulting party accountable.</p><p></p><p>3. "To do" or "not to do" in the context of obligation refers to the nature of the act or omission that is required or prohibited. In legal terms, an obligation to do something means that a person is required to perform a certain action. For example, a contract may impose an obligation on a seller to deliver goods to a buyer on a specific date. On the other hand, an obligation not to do something means that a person is prohibited from engaging in a particular action. For instance, a non-compete clause in an employment contract may obligate an employee not to work for a competitor for a certain period of time after the termination of employment.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Answer:<p></p>1. Refers to the juridical necessity to give, to do or not to do<p></p>2. In case of noncompliance, the courts of justice may be called upon by the aggrieved party to enforce its fulfillment<p></p>3. "to do" or "not to do" means:A duty to do or not to do something<p></p>Example:<p></p>TO DO. Obligation of a painter to create anartwork for the person whocommissioned him. NOT TO DO. The prestation not to do is a negative personal obligation.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Slavery was widespread in the Philippine islands before the archipelago was integrated into the Spanish Empire. Policies banning slavery that the Spanish crown established for its empire in the Americas were extended to its colony in the Philippines. The viceroyalty of New Spain oversaw the Philippine administratively, and the terminus of the Manila galleon in Acapulco sometimes saw the importation of Philippine slaves, who were labeled chinos. Crown policies regarding the favorable treatment of indigenous populations and prohibition of slavery were enforced in the Americas since the early 16th century.

While verbal communication is important, humans relied on nonverbal communication for thousands of years before we developed the capability to communicate with words. Nonverbal communication is a process of generating meaning using behavior other than words. Rather than thinking of nonverbal communication as the opposite of or as separate from verbal communication, it’s more accurate to view them as operating side by side—as part of the same system. Yet, as part of the same system, they still have important differences, including how the brain processes them. For instance, nonverbal communication is typically governed by the right side of the brain and verbal, the left.Peter A. Andersen, Nonverbal Communication: Forms and Functions (Mountain View, CA: Mayfield, 1999), 2–8. This hemispheric distinction has been clearly evidenced, as people who suffer trauma to the right side of their brain lose the ability to recognize facial expressions but can still process verbal communication. Conversely, people whose left hemisphere of the brain is damaged lose the ability to speak, read, and understand language. Interestingly, a person with damage to the left hemisphere of the brain who loses the ability to speak can often still sing since the creation, but not the reading, of music is governed by the right brain. The content and composition of verbal and nonverbal communication also differs. In terms of content, nonverbal communication tends to do the work of communicating emotions more than verbal. In terms of composition, although there are rules of grammar that structure our verbal communication, no such official guides govern our use of nonverbal signals. Likewise, there aren’t dictionaries and thesauruses of nonverbal communication like there are with verbal symbols. Finally, whereas we humans are unique in our capacity to abstract and transcend space and time using verbal symbols, we are not the only creatures that engage in nonverbal communication.Owen Hargie, Skilled Interpersonal Interaction: Research, Theory, and Practice, 5th ed. (London: Routledge, 2011), 49. These are just some of the characteristics that differentiate verbal communication from nonverbal, and in the remainder of this chapter we will discuss in more detail the principles, functions, and types of nonverbal communication and conclude with some guidance on how to improve our nonverbal communication competence.</p><br />
