This paper would have been even better if the student had added a sentence or two about the results of the study. That way, after reading the first paragraph, the reader would know the purpose, hypotheses, and findings. Next, the student described specifics about the research design, including the sample, instrumentation, and data analysis. Ecological and population generalizability were discussed. The student spoke at length on threats to internal validity. Following the information on threats to internal validity, the student provided suggestions regarding how these threats could have been dealt with. This shows a high level of understanding. Not only does the student know what the weakness of the study are, he provides ways the study could have been improved. One thing that was not discussed in this paper is the literature review. That's why you'll see some fairly complex explanations in this paper on the data analysis but no information on the literature review. Your paper will contain information on the literature review and less specific information on statistics.”What type of work is being critiqued?A. CreativeB. ResearchC. MediaD. Literarys​</a>

                                            In 1993, friends Marty Aquino and Jon Perez sought to set up a food cart business in the country. Based on their travel experiences, they decided that nachos-crispy chips that were typically dipped in a salsa-would be a viable product to offer as these were becoming increasingly available across the United States. These are often being of fered in places such as convenience stores, supermarkets, skating rinks, ski lodges, airports, and pubs. The question that their product will have to answer is, will Filipi- nos be as interested in nachos the same way that Americans have been growing in- creasingly fond of it?Adapting the flavors of their nachos to suit Filipino tastes, they soon created a food cart concept along with branding, packaging, and cart design. Their first cart was set up at SM City North Edsa in Quezon City, where it was located next to the movie thea- ters. Regular sized nachos were servings of 100 grams, topped with hot melted cheese. Additional toppings such as salsa, ground beef, and chili con carne were also available at a small add-on price for each toppings.Their first cart became a success. Duly inspired, Marty and Jon proceeded to open a second branch at the theater area of SM Megamall in Mandaluyong City. Soon, the new business was opening even more branches.Not all branches were doing well though. A cart at Robinson's Galleria mall in Pasig City, situated on the ground floor alongside other food carts, gave middling reve- nues. A cart at the Shangri-La Mall that was also situated next to other food carts on the ground floor delivered average performance. The same was observed with their cart in V-Mall at the Greenhills Commercial Center in Mandaluyong that was also situ- ated on the ground floor alongside other food carts.Then there were the problematic carts. At Ever Goteso Mall their cart was located next to the supermarket checkout. It was a mall that catered to the broad market, so there was a lot of foot traffic. However, few people paid attention to the nacho cart. The same was observed in their cart at the Tutuban Mall, a very populist mall in old Manila. Despite of the very heavy foot traffic, their cart that was at the entrance of supermarket was hardly patronized.Guide Question: 1. Identify the external factors that affects the Gourmet Nachos.

This paper would have been even better if the student had added a sentence or two about the results of the study. That way, after reading the first paragraph, the reader would know the purpose, hypotheses, and findings. Next, the student described specifics about the research design, including the sample, instrumentation, and data analysis. Ecological and population generalizability were discussed. The student spoke at length on threats to internal validity. Following the information on threats to internal validity, the student provided suggestions regarding how these threats could have been dealt with. This shows a high level of understanding. Not only does the student know what the weakness of the study are, he provides ways the study could have been improved. One thing that was not discussed in this paper is the literature review. That's why you'll see some fairly complex explanations in this paper on the data analysis but no information on the literature review. Your paper will contain information on the literature review and less specific information on statistics.”What type of work is being critiqued?A. CreativeB. ResearchC. MediaD. Literarys​</h2><br />

                            22. In 1993, friends Marty Aquino and Jon Perez sought to set up a food cart business in the country. Based on their travel experiences, they decided that nachos-crispy chips that were typically dipped in a salsa-would be a viable product to offer as these were becoming increasingly available across the United States. These are often being of fered in places such as convenience stores, supermarkets, skating rinks, ski lodges, airports, and pubs. The question that their product will have to answer is, will Filipi- nos be as interested in nachos the same way that Americans have been growing in- creasingly fond of it?Adapting the flavors of their nachos to suit Filipino tastes, they soon created a food cart concept along with branding, packaging, and cart design. Their first cart was set up at SM City North Edsa in Quezon City, where it was located next to the movie thea- ters. Regular sized nachos were servings of 100 grams, topped with hot melted cheese. Additional toppings such as salsa, ground beef, and chili con carne were also available at a small add-on price for each toppings.Their first cart became a success. Duly inspired, Marty and Jon proceeded to open a second branch at the theater area of SM Megamall in Mandaluyong City. Soon, the new business was opening even more branches.Not all branches were doing well though. A cart at Robinson's Galleria mall in Pasig City, situated on the ground floor alongside other food carts, gave middling reve- nues. A cart at the Shangri-La Mall that was also situated next to other food carts on the ground floor delivered average performance. The same was observed with their cart in V-Mall at the Greenhills Commercial Center in Mandaluyong that was also situ- ated on the ground floor alongside other food carts.Then there were the problematic carts. At Ever Goteso Mall their cart was located next to the supermarket checkout. It was a mall that catered to the broad market, so there was a lot of foot traffic.
