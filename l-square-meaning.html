Let's solve the given number. X times x equals x squared. That's the First. x times negative 3 equals negative 3x. That's the out. 1 times x equals 1x. That's the in. 1 times negative 3 equals negative 3. That's the last. X squared minus 3x plus 1x minus 3 is combination of answers. Then combine the similar terms 3x and 1x. Negative 3x plus 1x is equals to negative 2x. X squared minus 2x minus 3 is the overall answerHuhu kanta dapat. 'Cause yung PT namin is Create a Jingle that contains Math solutions. Thank You​</a>

Let's solve the given number. X times x equals x squared. That's the First. x times negative 3 equals negative 3x. That's the out. 1 times x equals 1x. That's the in. 1 times negative 3 equals negative 3. That's the last. X squared minus 3x plus 1x minus 3 is combination of answers. Then combine the similar terms 3x and 1x. Negative 3x plus 1x is equals to negative 2x. X squared minus 2x minus 3 is the overall answerHuhu kanta dapat. 'Cause yung PT namin is Create a Jingle that contains Math solutions.
