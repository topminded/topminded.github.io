                                            An Overview of Philippine Literature Historically speaking, Philippine literature can be divided into three most important periods: pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial All literary works produced before the Spanish colonization such as chants, proverbs, songs, and folk narratives are considered under pre-colonial period which are mostly of oral traditions. This is not because early Filipinos did not have system of writing yet but due to the unavailability of printing materials. Life was simple and so is literature during this period. If we have phones and other forms of technology to entertain us, our ancestors had literature for recreation who were noted for being music lover as more than 10 types of songs in various Philippine languages were discovered. Our forefathers also valued words of wisdom for teaching values as evidenced by numerous proverbs or salawikain Story telling was used to explain phenomenon and to teach lessons as well. Having bugtong or riddles was also a favorite past time and listening to narratives of bravery, magic, and heroism in epics was a box office hit. The focus of literature suddenly changed upon the arrival of Spaniards. An emphasis on morality and religion was common in literary forms such as Corrido, Pasyon, and Cenaculo. The production of printed materials started but it was mostly of religious purposes and themes. It was made in an attempt to instill traditional Spanish ways and cultures among the native Filipinos. Despite this indoctrination, native tradition still survived and flourished especially for areas where the colonial power was less popular. Literacy paved the way to develop sense of nationalism among Filipinos during the latter part of Spanish colonization. Filipinos started to write about oppression, corruption, and other social ills such as in the works of Dr. Jose P. Rizal entitled Noli Me Tangere and its sequel El Filibusterismo. The literary production during the American Period was inspired by the developments in education and culture. Knowledge and information became accessible to all Filipinos because of the free public education. During the apprenticeship period, the Filipino writers imitated English and American models. All forms of literature were explored by Filipino writers. During this period, short stories were the most prevalent literary form. With the new knowledge of English language, many writers started to gain recognition both locally and internationally like Jose Garcia Villa who earned the International title, "Poet of the Century" as an example. Philippine Literature was interrupted in its development when we were conquered by Japan between 1941-1945 since freedom of expression was uncommon back then. Filipino writers in the Philippines were forbidden to write anything against the government and only those who were in exile had the privilege to do so. As a result of banning the English language, short stories written in the vernaculars flourished in the country. The three most influential foreign invaders to the types of literature produced during colonial periods are Spanish, American, and Japanese wherein the common themes and subject mostly tackle about oppression, religion, freedom, or anything that reflects the experiences of Filipino people under the colonizers. The influences brought to us by colonial periods are said to have been extended up to the postcolonial periods especially in social and cultural dimensions. Post-colonial is the period after the rebirth of freedom in the Philippines up to the present. One of the most unforgotten and controversial periods during this era is having Martial Law during the Marcos regime. All of the periods mentioned are essential towards understanding the types of literature being produced in the Philippines ACTIVITY 1-4 VOCABULARY DEVELOPMENT:difine the meaning of each word based on how it is used in the paragraph1.stock (paragraph 1)2.piousness(paragraph2)3.culminated (paragraph 3)4.interspersed(paragraph 4)5.prominent (paragraph 11) ​</a>

                                            Direction: Rewrite the following text using an impersonal style of writing. I want to argue that all children in Philippines have the right to be educated in their mother tongue. I expect that many children in the past spent months or years in school but did not understand the lessons. I am convinced that many migrant children are failing in our education system because we do not have bilingual education programs. If we look at the U.N. report on language and education, we can discover that children who become literate in their own language have the greatest chance of educational success. People have been discussing the latest figures on university entrance recently and you can tell that migrant child do less well than “Aeta” children at present. I suspect that this is because they have difficulty with English and I would claim that the government has done too little to help these children. Surely the best way to achieve this in Philippines is for the State governments to set up bilingual education programs for all migrant children. I would suggest that this is the number one important issue for multicultural Philippines.​</a>

                                            People and ReligionDepartment of Tourism1The Filipino is basically of Malay stock with a sprinkling of Chinese, American, Spanish, and Arab blood. The Philippines has a population of 76.5 million 
as of May 2000, and it is hard to distinguish accurately the lines between stocks. 
From a long history of Western colonial rule, interspersed with the visits of merchants and traders, evolved a people of a unique blend of east and west, both in 
appearance and culture.2The Filipino character is actually a little bit of all the cultures put together. The bayanihan or spirit of kinship and camaraderie that Filipinos are famous for is said to be taken from Malay forefathers. The close family relations are said to have been inherited from the Chinese. The piousness comes from the Spaniards who introduced Christianity in the 16th century. Hospitality is a common denominator in the Filipino character and this is what distinguishes the Filipino. Filipinos are probably one of the few, if not the only, English-proficient Oriental people today. Pilipino is the official national language, with English considered as the country's unofficial one.3The Filipinos are divided geographically and culturally into regions, and each regional group is recognizable by distinct traits and dialects - the sturdy and frugal llocanos of the north, the industrious Tagalogs of the central plains, the carefree Visayans from the central islands, and the colorful tribesmen and religious Moslems of Mindanao. Tribal communities can be found scattered across the archipelago. The Philippines has more than 111 dialects spoken, owing to the subdivisions of these basic regional and cultural groups.4The country is marked by a true blend of cultures; truly in the Philippines, East meets West. The background of the people is Indonesian and Malay. There are Chinese and Spanish elements as well. The history of American rule and contact with merchants and traders culminated in a unique blend of East and West, both in the appearance and culture of the Filipinos, or people of the Philippines.5Hospitality, a trait displayed by every Filipino, makes these people legendary in Southeast Asia. Seldom can you find such hospitable people who enjoy the company of their Western visitors. Perhaps due to their long association with Spain, Filipinos are emotional and passionate about life in a way that seems more Latin than Asian.6The Spaniards introduced Christianity (the Roman Catholic faith) and succeeded in converting the overwhelming majority of Filipinos. At least 83% of the total population belongs to the Roman Catholic faith.7The American occupation was responsible for teaching the Filipino people the English language. The Philippines is currently the third-largest English speaking country in the world.8Historically, the Filipinos have embraced two of the great religions of the world - Islam and Christianity. Islam was introduced during the 14th century shortly after the expansion of Arab commercial ventures in Southeast Asia. Today, it is limited to the southern region of the country.9Christianity was introduced as early as the 16th century with the coming of Ferdinand Magellan in 1521.10Protestantism was introduced by the first Presbyterian and Methodist missionaries who arrived with the American soldiers in 1899.11Two Filipino independent churches were organized at the turn of the century and are prominent today. These are the Aglipay (Philippine Independent Church) and the Iglesia Ni Kristo (Church of Christ) founded in 1902 and 1914, respectively. Recently the Aglipay signed a covenant with the Anglican Church. The Iglesia ni Kristo has expanded its membership considerably. Its churches, with their unique towering architecture, are landmarks in almost all important towns, provincial capitals, and major cities.ASSESSMENT 2: Do as instructed. 2a.

                            6. An Overview of Philippine Literature Historically speaking, Philippine literature can be divided into three most important periods: pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial All literary works produced before the Spanish colonization such as chants, proverbs, songs, and folk narratives are considered under pre-colonial period which are mostly of oral traditions. This is not because early Filipinos did not have system of writing yet but due to the unavailability of printing materials. Life was simple and so is literature during this period. If we have phones and other forms of technology to entertain us, our ancestors had literature for recreation who were noted for being music lover as more than 10 types of songs in various Philippine languages were discovered. Our forefathers also valued words of wisdom for teaching values as evidenced by numerous proverbs or salawikain Story telling was used to explain phenomenon and to teach lessons as well. Having bugtong or riddles was also a favorite past time and listening to narratives of bravery, magic, and heroism in epics was a box office hit. The focus of literature suddenly changed upon the arrival of Spaniards. An emphasis on morality and religion was common in literary forms such as Corrido, Pasyon, and Cenaculo. The production of printed materials started but it was mostly of religious purposes and themes. It was made in an attempt to instill traditional Spanish ways and cultures among the native Filipinos. Despite this indoctrination, native tradition still survived and flourished especially for areas where the colonial power was less popular. Literacy paved the way to develop sense of nationalism among Filipinos during the latter part of Spanish colonization. Filipinos started to write about oppression, corruption, and other social ills such as in the works of Dr. Jose P. Rizal entitled Noli Me Tangere and its sequel El Filibusterismo. The literary production during the American Period was inspired by the developments in education and culture. Knowledge and information became accessible to all Filipinos because of the free public education. During the apprenticeship period, the Filipino writers imitated English and American models. All forms of literature were explored by Filipino writers. During this period, short stories were the most prevalent literary form. With the new knowledge of English language, many writers started to gain recognition both locally and internationally like Jose Garcia Villa who earned the International title, "Poet of the Century" as an example. Philippine Literature was interrupted in its development when we were conquered by Japan between 1941-1945 since freedom of expression was uncommon back then. Filipino writers in the Philippines were forbidden to write anything against the government and only those who were in exile had the privilege to do so. As a result of banning the English language, short stories written in the vernaculars flourished in the country. The three most influential foreign invaders to the types of literature produced during colonial periods are Spanish, American, and Japanese wherein the common themes and subject mostly tackle about oppression, religion, freedom, or anything that reflects the experiences of Filipino people under the colonizers. The influences brought to us by colonial periods are said to have been extended up to the postcolonial periods especially in social and cultural dimensions. Post-colonial is the period after the rebirth of freedom in the Philippines up to the present. One of the most unforgotten and controversial periods during this era is having Martial Law during the Marcos regime. All of the periods mentioned are essential towards understanding the types of literature being produced in the Philippines ACTIVITY 1-4 VOCABULARY DEVELOPMENT:difine the meaning of each word based on how it is used in the paragraph1.stock (paragraph 1)2.piousness(paragraph2)3.culminated (paragraph 3)4.interspersed(paragraph 4)5.prominent (paragraph 11) ​</h2><br />

                            11. Direction: Rewrite the following text using an impersonal style of writing. I want to argue that all children in Philippines have the right to be educated in their mother tongue. I expect that many children in the past spent months or years in school but did not understand the lessons. I am convinced that many migrant children are failing in our education system because we do not have bilingual education programs. If we look at the U.N. report on language and education, we can discover that children who become literate in their own language have the greatest chance of educational success. People have been discussing the latest figures on university entrance recently and you can tell that migrant child do less well than “Aeta” children at present. I suspect that this is because they have difficulty with English and I would claim that the government has done too little to help these children. Surely the best way to achieve this in Philippines is for the State governments to set up bilingual education programs for all migrant children. I would suggest that this is the number one important issue for multicultural Philippines.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In 2013, the Philippines made a bold move by including an array of native languages in the basic education system, which was commended by international organizations like UNESCO, academic conferences, and advocates of fair, culturally-appropriate, and accessible education.  </p><p>
</p><p>This program, called Mother Tongue-Based Multilingual Education (MTB-MLE), was an emblem of hope for children of minorities who would be able to understand instruction better in their home languages, and participate more actively in the learning process. Through this program, the Philippines showed a strong example to other countries in making education more inclusive, and in its commitment to cultural and linguistic diversity.  </p><p>
</p><p>Now, some lawmakers want to abolish mother tongues from schools. We believe this would be a huge step backwards. Here are 10 reasons why the the mother tongue program should be saved.  </p><p>

Do you think you would know the other local names of animals if you go to another region? 2. Why do you think it is important for scientists to have a scientific name for an animal? (2 points)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Yes, the three organisms have different names in different languages. For example, "dog" in Tagalog is "aso" while in Waray it is "ayam".</p><p></p><p>2. Yes, it is possible that different regions in the Philippines have their own local names for animals. This is because the Philippines has a diverse culture and language, with different regions having their own unique dialects and terminologies.</p><p></p><p>3. It is important for scientists to have a scientific name for an animal because common names can vary across regions and languages, making it difficult for scientists to communicate about the same animal. Scientific names, on the other hand, are universally accepted and understood by scientists around the world. This helps to avoid confusion and ensure accuracy in scientific research and communication.</p><br />

                            21. People and ReligionDepartment of Tourism1The Filipino is basically of Malay stock with a sprinkling of Chinese, American, Spanish, and Arab blood. The Philippines has a population of 76.5 million 
as of May 2000, and it is hard to distinguish accurately the lines between stocks. 
From a long history of Western colonial rule, interspersed with the visits of merchants and traders, evolved a people of a unique blend of east and west, both in 
appearance and culture.2The Filipino character is actually a little bit of all the cultures put together. The bayanihan or spirit of kinship and camaraderie that Filipinos are famous for is said to be taken from Malay forefathers. The close family relations are said to have been inherited from the Chinese. The piousness comes from the Spaniards who introduced Christianity in the 16th century. Hospitality is a common denominator in the Filipino character and this is what distinguishes the Filipino. Filipinos are probably one of the few, if not the only, English-proficient Oriental people today. Pilipino is the official national language, with English considered as the country's unofficial one.3The Filipinos are divided geographically and culturally into regions, and each regional group is recognizable by distinct traits and dialects - the sturdy and frugal llocanos of the north, the industrious Tagalogs of the central plains, the carefree Visayans from the central islands, and the colorful tribesmen and religious Moslems of Mindanao. Tribal communities can be found scattered across the archipelago. The Philippines has more than 111 dialects spoken, owing to the subdivisions of these basic regional and cultural groups.4The country is marked by a true blend of cultures; truly in the Philippines, East meets West. The background of the people is Indonesian and Malay. There are Chinese and Spanish elements as well. The history of American rule and contact with merchants and traders culminated in a unique blend of East and West, both in the appearance and culture of the Filipinos, or people of the Philippines.5Hospitality, a trait displayed by every Filipino, makes these people legendary in Southeast Asia. Seldom can you find such hospitable people who enjoy the company of their Western visitors. Perhaps due to their long association with Spain, Filipinos are emotional and passionate about life in a way that seems more Latin than Asian.6The Spaniards introduced Christianity (the Roman Catholic faith) and succeeded in converting the overwhelming majority of Filipinos. At least 83% of the total population belongs to the Roman Catholic faith.7The American occupation was responsible for teaching the Filipino people the English language. The Philippines is currently the third-largest English speaking country in the world.8Historically, the Filipinos have embraced two of the great religions of the world - Islam and Christianity. Islam was introduced during the 14th century shortly after the expansion of Arab commercial ventures in Southeast Asia. Today, it is limited to the southern region of the country.9Christianity was introduced as early as the 16th century with the coming of Ferdinand Magellan in 1521.10Protestantism was introduced by the first Presbyterian and Methodist missionaries who arrived with the American soldiers in 1899.11Two Filipino independent churches were organized at the turn of the century and are prominent today. These are the Aglipay (Philippine Independent Church) and the Iglesia Ni Kristo (Church of Christ) founded in 1902 and 1914, respectively. Recently the Aglipay signed a covenant with the Anglican Church. The Iglesia ni Kristo has expanded its membership considerably. Its churches, with their unique towering architecture, are landmarks in almost all important towns, provincial capitals, and major cities.ASSESSMENT 2: Do as instructed. 2a.

Today, I would like to talk about the importance of education.</p><p></p><p>BODY: Education is an essential ingredient in developing individuals and societies. It is through education that people gain knowledge, skills, and values that enable them to overcome challenges and achieve their goals. The benefits of education are vast, from personal growth to social and economic development. For one, education can improve people's lives by giving them a better understanding of the world around them. It allows them to make informed decisions and think critically. Moreover, education can unlock opportunities for people, such as higher-paid jobs, improved health outcomes, and increased participation in civic life.</p><p></p><p>Another reason why education is essential is that it builds character, instills values, and shapes attitudes. Education cultivates a sense of responsibility, respect for others, and a desire for lifelong learning. Also, it promotes tolerance, empathy, and understanding between cultures and communities. Education can foster social cohesion and harmony, which are critical in building peaceful and prosperous societies.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, education is an investment in the future. It is through education that we can address the complex challenges facing our world, such as poverty, inequality, and climate change. By equipping people with the right skills and knowledge, education can help create a more sustainable and equitable world.</p><p></p><p>AND CONCLUSION: In conclusion, education is crucial in shaping the future of individuals and communities. It empowers people to fulfill their potential, contribute to society, and make a positive impact on the world. Therefore, let us all recognize the importance of education and work to ensure that everyone has access to quality education and lifelong learning opportunities. Thank you.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
