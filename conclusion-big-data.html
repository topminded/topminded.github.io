                                            THIRD QUARTER PERFORMANCE TASK 1ENGLISH 9DIRECTION: Read the following text carefully and extract information by answering the given items.Why Students Should Eat Breakfast Every DayA lot of people, especially young people, go through the day without having breakfast. Many people believe that it is notnecessary, or they say that they don't have time for that, and begin their day with no meal. I believe that everyone should eatbreakfast before going to their activities. The purpose of this paper is to show the importance of breakfast, especially for students.The first reason why you should eat breakfast before going to school is for your health. When you skip breakfast and go toschool, you are looking for a disease because it's not healthy to have an empty stomach all day long. It's very important to have ameal and not let your stomach work empty. All you are going to get is gastritis and a lot of problems with your health if you don'teat breakfast.Another reason for eating breakfast is because you need food for to do well in your classes. Your body and your brain arenot going to function as good as they could because you have no energy and no strength. When you try to learn something andhave nothing in your stomach, you are going to have a lot of trouble succeeding. A lot of people think that they should not eatbecause they are going to feel tired, but that's not true. Breakfast is not a very big meal, and on the contrary, you're going to feeltired if you don't have breakfast because you have spent the entire previous night without food.The last reason to have breakfast every day is because you can avoid diseases if you eat some breakfast in the morning.If you don't eat, you are going to get sick, and these diseases will have a stronger effect on you because you're going to get sickeasier than people who have breakfast every day.You have to realize that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and you cannot skip it without consequences foryour health, your school and your defense mechanism. It is better to wake up earlier and have a good breakfast than run to schoolwithout eating anything. It is time for you to do something for your health, and eating breakfast is the better way to start your day.Claim:Counterargument:Data/Evidences:1.2.3.Conclusion:please kailangan ko tlaga ng tulong  please​</a>

                                            English 10 Quarter 3 – Module 3Informative text is a kind of text that offers data, definitions, and descriptions of phenomena or details about a fact. It introduces a clearly stated topic and creates an organizational structure in which related information is grouped logically to support the purpose of writing. It develops evidence with relevant facts, definitions, concrete details, quotations, and examples with references. It also uses appropriate linking ideas within and across paragraphs to smoothly and purposefully connect the controlling idea to evidence and provides a satisfying conclusion related to the topic.WHAT’S INArticles, textbook chapters, passages, paragraphs or sentences have topics and main ideas. Locating the topic, main idea, and supporting details is important in helping you understand what the writer is attempting to express. Moreover, identifying the relationship between these will also increase your comprehension.In writing an informative essay, you have to keep in mind that the main idea is the point of the paragraph and it is the most important thought about the topic. The main idea is usually a sentence and it can be in different places within a paragraph.Here’s a sample paragraph and let’s try your skill in finding the main idea. Try to locate the topic first, and then look for the main idea.Most teenagers and young adults do not know what they want to do for the rest of their lives. It is a big decision. There are things you can do to narrow the choices. For example you can take an interest test, do some research on your own about a career, try volunteer work in the field in which you are interested, or “job shadow” in which you spend a day with a person who is working in the field that interests you. These are just a few helpful ideas as you begin to choose a career.The topic is _______________________________________________________. The main idea is __________________________________________________.​</a>

                            10. THIRD QUARTER PERFORMANCE TASK 1ENGLISH 9DIRECTION: Read the following text carefully and extract information by answering the given items.Why Students Should Eat Breakfast Every DayA lot of people, especially young people, go through the day without having breakfast. Many people believe that it is notnecessary, or they say that they don't have time for that, and begin their day with no meal. I believe that everyone should eatbreakfast before going to their activities. The purpose of this paper is to show the importance of breakfast, especially for students.The first reason why you should eat breakfast before going to school is for your health. When you skip breakfast and go toschool, you are looking for a disease because it's not healthy to have an empty stomach all day long. It's very important to have ameal and not let your stomach work empty. All you are going to get is gastritis and a lot of problems with your health if you don'teat breakfast.Another reason for eating breakfast is because you need food for to do well in your classes. Your body and your brain arenot going to function as good as they could because you have no energy and no strength. When you try to learn something andhave nothing in your stomach, you are going to have a lot of trouble succeeding. A lot of people think that they should not eatbecause they are going to feel tired, but that's not true. Breakfast is not a very big meal, and on the contrary, you're going to feeltired if you don't have breakfast because you have spent the entire previous night without food.The last reason to have breakfast every day is because you can avoid diseases if you eat some breakfast in the morning.If you don't eat, you are going to get sick, and these diseases will have a stronger effect on you because you're going to get sickeasier than people who have breakfast every day.You have to realize that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and you cannot skip it without consequences foryour health, your school and your defense mechanism. It is better to wake up earlier and have a good breakfast than run to schoolwithout eating anything. It is time for you to do something for your health, and eating breakfast is the better way to start your day.Claim:Counterargument:Data/Evidences:1.2.3.Conclusion:please kailangan ko tlaga ng tulong  please​</h2><br />

                            11. English 10 Quarter 3 – Module 3Informative text is a kind of text that offers data, definitions, and descriptions of phenomena or details about a fact. It introduces a clearly stated topic and creates an organizational structure in which related information is grouped logically to support the purpose of writing. It develops evidence with relevant facts, definitions, concrete details, quotations, and examples with references. It also uses appropriate linking ideas within and across paragraphs to smoothly and purposefully connect the controlling idea to evidence and provides a satisfying conclusion related to the topic.WHAT’S INArticles, textbook chapters, passages, paragraphs or sentences have topics and main ideas. Locating the topic, main idea, and supporting details is important in helping you understand what the writer is attempting to express. Moreover, identifying the relationship between these will also increase your comprehension.In writing an informative essay, you have to keep in mind that the main idea is the point of the paragraph and it is the most important thought about the topic. The main idea is usually a sentence and it can be in different places within a paragraph.Here’s a sample paragraph and let’s try your skill in finding the main idea. Try to locate the topic first, and then look for the main idea.Most teenagers and young adults do not know what they want to do for the rest of their lives. It is a big decision. There are things you can do to narrow the choices. For example you can take an interest test, do some research on your own about a career, try volunteer work in the field in which you are interested, or “job shadow” in which you spend a day with a person who is working in the field that interests you. These are just a few helpful ideas as you begin to choose a career.The topic is _______________________________________________________. The main idea is __________________________________________________.​</h2><br />
