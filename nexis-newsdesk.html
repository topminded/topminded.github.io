COVID-19 cases rise as testing increased, clearing of backlogBy NewsDesk @ infectiousdiseasenewsMay 31, 2020Philippines health officials reported an additional 590 confined COVID-19 casestoday, bringing the country total to 17,224The number of daily confirmed cases has risen as a result of increased testing and theDepartment of Health's (DOH) aggressive efforts to catch up on the testing backlog,according to Health OIC-Undersecretary Dr. Maria Rosario Singh-Vergeire.According to the DOH,"fresh cases” refer to test results came out and were validatedby the Epidemiology Bureau in the last three days. “Late cases" are those whoseresults came out four days ago or more but were just recently confirmed.Of the newly reported cases today, 252 are "fresh cases", while 338 are "late" cases.Much of the reporting of COVID-19 cases has experienced a delay due to operationalissues with the manual data collection. According to public health epidemiologist Dr.Troy Gepte, this delay needs to be taken into consideration when reading the numbers,because they do not translate to an increase in local transmission at that very moment.In addition, eight deaths were reported today, putting the total death count at 950.Officials say mortality due to COVID-19 has been on the decline since late March,assuring the DOH that the healthcare sector's treatment of the illness has beenprogressively improvingSource: http://outbreaknewstoday.com/philippines-covid-19-cases-rise-as-testing increased clearing-of-backlog-93002/whats in the news?who?what?when?where?how?why?​paki sagot  po plss lng nag maka  awa po ako sainyo na sana sagotan  nyo   po ito ngayon​</a>
