Business finance is a term that encompasses a wide range of activities and disciplines revolving around the management of money and other valuable assets. Business finance programs in universities familiarize students with accounting methodologies, investing strategies and effective debt management. Small business owners must have a solid understanding of the principles of finance to keep their companies profitable.
Significance
Financing, simply put, is the act of bringing money into an organization. Businesses can be financed in a number of ways, each of which features its own advantages, disadvantages and unique features. Common methods of financing a business include taking on debt and taking advantage of credit arrangements, financing through equity investment or earning income through investment products that bear interest or increase in value.
Time Frame
Properly managed debt can help a small business to finance steady or rapid expansion. Loans from banks and credit unions can be structured in a number of ways; borrowers with established reputations and high credit scores have access to larger amounts of debt capital at lower interest rates with more friendly fee structures. Small business owners should have a plan for building up their company's credit score over time.
Types
Equity financing can be obtained via several avenues. Investment from venture capitalists or angel investors can provide a significant influx of capital, not to mention access to expert guidance, for businesses in the startup phase. More established businesses can incorporate and sell shares of stock to the public to raise large amounts of debt-free capital, at the expense of diluting ownership and control of the company among a wider range of individuals and organizations.
Considerations
Making wise and profitable investments can finance business operations with no strings attached. Investing in conservative products such as blue-chip bonds, interest-bearing bank deposits and trusted dividend-paying stocks can help a business to diversify its income, hedging itself against risks in the marketplace.
Warning
Each type of financing should be used with caution and vigilance. Taking on too much debt can dilute company performance metrics such as the debt-to-assets and times-interest-earned ratios, as well as reducing profit margins. Financing too heavily through equity can cause original company founders to lose control of the company completely over time. Investing too much money in risky investments can cause a company to lose its cash reserves quickly.</a>

                                            DEVLOPING A STRATEEGIC PROSPECTING PLAN BACKGROUND: Jennifer Hamman graduated from the state university and was hired as a sales representative for the Logistics Company. The Logistics Company is a transportation broker that links companies needing products shipped with trucking firms to carry the shipments. After an initial training program, Jennifer was given a couple of existing company customers and a small list of leads to get her started. She began by serving the shipment needs of the existing customers. This gave her some confidence, but she realized that for her to be successful, she must begin prospecting and try to identify the best sales opportunities. The Logistics Company provides an ongoing list of leads that can be accessed by all salespeople. Once a salesperson contacts one of these lead, no other salesperson can contact then. Jennifer started her prospecting by contacting these leads. CURRENT SITUATION: Jennifer has been calling a number of leads each day, but has not been very successful in generating much business. She feels like she is wasting much of her time on leads that are not good sales opportunities. The leads provided by her company are not qualified in any way and the training program she attended focused on cold calling as the basic prospecting method. Jennifer took a professional selling class in college and remembered that the chapter on prospecting emphasized the need to follow the strategic prospecting process to identify the best sales opportunities. She found her professional selling textbook, went to the chapter on prospecting, and decided to create a strategic prospecting plan. QUESTIONS: What methods should Jennifer use to generate sales leads beyond those provided by her company? How should Jennifer qualify the leads provided by her company and those she generates herself? What is the profile of an ideal prospects? How should Jennifer prioritize her qualified prospects? What information should Jennifer collect to prepare for sales dialogue with a prospect? Jennifer used Linkedin during college and wanted to employ it in her strategic prospecting process. How can she best use Linkedin?​</a>

Business finance is a term that encompasses a wide range of activities and disciplines revolving around the management of money and other valuable assets. Business finance programs in universities familiarize students with accounting methodologies, investing strategies and effective debt management. Small business owners must have a solid understanding of the principles of finance to keep their companies profitable.
Significance
Financing, simply put, is the act of bringing money into an organization. Businesses can be financed in a number of ways, each of which features its own advantages, disadvantages and unique features. Common methods of financing a business include taking on debt and taking advantage of credit arrangements, financing through equity investment or earning income through investment products that bear interest or increase in value.
Time Frame
Properly managed debt can help a small business to finance steady or rapid expansion. Loans from banks and credit unions can be structured in a number of ways; borrowers with established reputations and high credit scores have access to larger amounts of debt capital at lower interest rates with more friendly fee structures. Small business owners should have a plan for building up their company's credit score over time.
Types
Equity financing can be obtained via several avenues. Investment from venture capitalists or angel investors can provide a significant influx of capital, not to mention access to expert guidance, for businesses in the startup phase. More established businesses can incorporate and sell shares of stock to the public to raise large amounts of debt-free capital, at the expense of diluting ownership and control of the company among a wider range of individuals and organizations.
Considerations
Making wise and profitable investments can finance business operations with no strings attached. Investing in conservative products such as blue-chip bonds, interest-bearing bank deposits and trusted dividend-paying stocks can help a business to diversify its income, hedging itself against risks in the marketplace.
Warning
Each type of financing should be used with caution and vigilance. Taking on too much debt can dilute company performance metrics such as the debt-to-assets and times-interest-earned ratios, as well as reducing profit margins. Financing too heavily through equity can cause original company founders to lose control of the company completely over time. Investing too much money in risky investments can cause a company to lose its cash reserves quickly.</h2><br />

                            21. DEVLOPING A STRATEEGIC PROSPECTING PLAN BACKGROUND: Jennifer Hamman graduated from the state university and was hired as a sales representative for the Logistics Company. The Logistics Company is a transportation broker that links companies needing products shipped with trucking firms to carry the shipments. After an initial training program, Jennifer was given a couple of existing company customers and a small list of leads to get her started. She began by serving the shipment needs of the existing customers. This gave her some confidence, but she realized that for her to be successful, she must begin prospecting and try to identify the best sales opportunities. The Logistics Company provides an ongoing list of leads that can be accessed by all salespeople. Once a salesperson contacts one of these lead, no other salesperson can contact then. Jennifer started her prospecting by contacting these leads. CURRENT SITUATION: Jennifer has been calling a number of leads each day, but has not been very successful in generating much business. She feels like she is wasting much of her time on leads that are not good sales opportunities. The leads provided by her company are not qualified in any way and the training program she attended focused on cold calling as the basic prospecting method. Jennifer took a professional selling class in college and remembered that the chapter on prospecting emphasized the need to follow the strategic prospecting process to identify the best sales opportunities. She found her professional selling textbook, went to the chapter on prospecting, and decided to create a strategic prospecting plan. QUESTIONS: What methods should Jennifer use to generate sales leads beyond those provided by her company? How should Jennifer qualify the leads provided by her company and those she generates herself? What is the profile of an ideal prospects? How should Jennifer prioritize her qualified prospects? What information should Jennifer collect to prepare for sales dialogue with a prospect? Jennifer used Linkedin during college and wanted to employ it in her strategic prospecting process. How can she best use Linkedin?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>To generate sales leads beyond those provided by her company, Jennifer could use a variety of methods, such as networking, attending industry events, and conducting research to identify potential customers. She could also consider leveraging social media, such as LinkedIn, to connect with potential customers and identify potential sales opportunities.</p><p></p><p>To qualify the leads provided by her company and those she generates herself, Jennifer should consider factors such as the potential customer's industry, size, location, and shipping needs. She should also consider whether the potential customer has a need for the services offered by the Logistics Company, and whether the potential customer has the ability to pay for those services.</p><p></p><p>The profile of an ideal prospect for Jennifer would likely include companies in industries that require frequent shipping, such as manufacturing or retail, and are located in close proximity to the Logistics Company's network of trucking partners. These companies would also need to have a significant volume of shipments and the ability to pay for the Logistics Company's services.</p><p></p><p>To prioritize her qualified prospects, Jennifer should consider factors such as the potential customer's industry, size, location, and shipping needs. She should also consider the potential customer's likelihood to use the Logistics Company's services, as well as the potential value of the customer to the company.</p><p></p><p>To prepare for sales dialogue with a prospect, Jennifer should collect information such as the potential customer's industry, size, location, and shipping needs. She should also research the potential customer's current shipping methods and any potential pain points or challenges they may be facing, as well as the potential customer's decision-making process and key decision makers.</p><p></p><p>To best use LinkedIn in her strategic prospecting process, Jennifer could use the platform to connect with potential customers and identify potential sales opportunities. She could also use LinkedIn to research potential customers and gather information about their industry, size, location, and shipping needs. Additionally, she could use LinkedIn to network with other professionals in the transportation and logistics industry, and to identify potential partners or referral sources.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Methods to Generate Sales Leads: Jennifer should consider using a variety of methods to generate sales leads. She can search for industry-specific trade shows, use online databases to search for potential customers, cold call, network with existing contacts, use referrals from current customers, and use social media platforms such as LinkedIn. </p><p></p><p>2. Qualifying Leads: To qualify leads, Jennifer should create a set of criteria that the leads must meet in order to be considered a qualified prospect. This criteria should include things such as industry, size of company, location, and the types of services the company is likely to need. </p><p></p><p>3. Profile of an Ideal Prospect: An ideal prospect would be a company in the logistics industry with a need for transportation services, preferably within the same region as the Logistics Company. The company should be of a size that can afford the services, and have a track record of reliability and trustworthiness. </p><p></p><p>4. Prioritizing Qualified Prospects: Once Jennifer has identified and qualified her prospects, she should prioritize them based on their likelihood of becoming a customer. She should focus on the prospects that are most likely to need the services the Logistics Company offers, and the ones that have the most potential for generating long-term business. </p><p></p><p>5. Preparing for Sales Dialogue: Jennifer should collect as much information as possible about each prospect before engaging in a sales dialogue. This should include researching the company, its history, its current needs and opportunities, and the contacts that she will be speaking with. She should also use this research to craft a message that is tailored to the prospect’s needs. </p><p></p><p>6. Using LinkedIn: Jennifer can use LinkedIn to search for qualified prospects and to research them. She can also use the platform to network with contacts in the industry, such as other companies in the logistics industry, to get referrals and build relationships. Additionally, she can use LinkedIn to post about the services offered by the Logistics Company to spread awareness and generate leads.</p><br />
