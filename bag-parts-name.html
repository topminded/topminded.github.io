                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>A.</strong></p><p>1. Prokaryote, also spelled procaryote, any organism that lacks a distinct nucleus and other organelles due to the absence of internal membranes. Bacteria are among the best-known prokaryotic organisms. The lack of internal membranes in prokaryotes distinguishes them from eukaryotes.</p><p>2. Eukaryote, any cell or organism that possesses a clearly defined nucleus. The eukaryotic cell has a nuclear membrane that surrounds the nucleus, in which the well-defined chromosomes (bodies containing the hereditary material) are located.</p><p>3.  A class or a category is a set of properties or characteristics. They may be related or connected, but that is not the primary aspect of the category. It is a descriptive template.</p><p>4. An organelle (think of it as a cell's internal organ) is a membrane bound structure found within a cell. Just like cells have membranes to hold everything in, these mini-organs are also bound in a double layer of phospholipids to insulate their little compartments within the larger cells.</p><p>5. By the late 1830s, botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist Theodor Schwann were studying tissues and proposed the unified cell theory. The unified cell theory states that: all living things are composed of one or more cells; the cell is the basic unit of life; and new cells arise from existing cells.</p><p><strong>B.</strong></p><p>1. Structurally, plant and animal cells are very similar because they are both eukaryotic cells. They both contain membrane-bound organelles such as the nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and peroxisomes.</p><p>2. Plant cells have cell walls, one large vacuole per cell, and chloroplasts, while animal cells will have a cell membrane only and several smaller vacuoles. Animal cells also have a centriole, which is not found in most plant cells.</p><p>3. Animal cells and plant cells share the common components of a nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondria and a cell membrane. Plant cells have three extra components, a vacuole, chloroplast and a cell wall.</p><p>4. Animal cells each have a centrosome and lysosomes, whereas plant cells do not. Plant cells have a cell wall, chloroplasts and other specialized plastids, and a large central vacuole, whereas animal cells do not.</p><p>5. Cell Membrane	Is made out of phospholipids and proteins
</p><p>Mitochondrion	Site of cellular respiration "power house"
</p><p>Lysosome	Suicide Sacks that contain digestive enzymes
</p><p>Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum	Contains Ribosomes, transports proteins and other materials</p><p><strong>Hope it helps</strong></p><br />
