Sunscreens protect our skin so we can stay under the sun all day.3. The higher the Sun Protection Factor (SPF) in a sunscreen, the higher the protection.4. Sunglasses have UV coating that help block harmful rays from the sun.5. Too much exposure to UV rays may increase the risk for skin cancer and cataracts.6. Visible light is the only EM wave that can be seen by human eye.7. Sun is the only source of natural white light.8. Rainbow is formed when light refracts at different angles.9.

Visible light which is also used in optical fibers, artificial lights and screens of electronic devices.14. Gamma rays can cause and also treat cancers. High doses of gamma rays kill the normal cellscausing cancer while proper amount can kill mutated cells.15. Radio/television signals, GPS and MRI are practical applications of radio waves.16.

When I got home from school after a long boring day, I took out the peanut bu bread. After taking the lid off of the jars, I spread the peanut butter on one side of the brea on the other, and then I put the two pieces of bread together. After that, I enjoyed it while "Cops" on the TV. I swear, that was the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich I ever ate. 2. All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not make-up or identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but Changing the shape of clay is a physical change, and does not change the matter's ider changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is to changes are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are perman they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter. 3. Dr. Miller doesn't want the tigers to vanish. These majestic beasts are dis alarming rate. Dr. Miller thinks that we should write to our congress people. If we let demand the preservation of this species, maybe we can make a difference. Dr. Miller should donate to Save the Tigers.

All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not make-up or identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but Changing the shape of clay is a physical change, and does not change the matter's ider changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is to changes are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are perman they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter. 3. Dr. Miller doesn't want the tigers to vanish. These majestic beasts are dis alarming rate.
