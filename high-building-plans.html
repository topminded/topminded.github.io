                        <p> </p><p>ANSWER:  </p><p></p><p>          The Bataan nuclear power plant was built in the 1970s, but it was never commissioned. Officials in the Philippines have discussed upgrading the plant, and finally bringing it online, as part of the country’s nuclear program. Source: Creative Commons / Jiru27</p><p>Previous discussions of starting up the Bataan plant (Figure 1) gained little traction, owing to safety concerns and the plant’s ties to former President Ferdinand Marcos and his martial law regime. Marcos, who ruled as a dictator for more than 20 years, in 1976 ordered construction of the Bataan plant in response to the global energy crisis; he maintained that nuclear energy was the country’s answer to the Middle East oil embargo that had created economic challenges. The plant was never fueled, though, due to safety concerns after the Three Mile Island accident in the U.S. in 1979, and the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 in the then-Soviet Union.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>I hope it's  helped </p><br />

                            17. 2. You were assigned as the head engineer of a government project to design structures for a coastal area that suffers from saltwater intrusion , high waves, and storm surges. Plan the structures and management that you would like to apply for this coastal area. Provide a ssketch and a short explanation for each structure that you plan to build.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Until the latter part of the 1900s, the use of hard structures in coastal areas (sometimes termed coastal armoring), was the preferred method for reducing the effects of waves, storm surge, and erosion. However, over recent decades, U.S. Army of Corps of Engineers (USACE) beach nourishment and dune building outnumbered hard structures in terms of both the number and miles of projects constructed (see Figure 1-9). Additional approaches use natural or restored habitats to help reduce the impact of waves and storm surge, and/or building design and nonstructural land-use strategies to reduce the consequences of a hazardous event. This chapter discusses the various coastal risk reduction strategies and reviews what is known about their proven performance, including their economic costs and benefits and environmental effects.</p><p>Isolating the economic value of coastal risk reduction projects in comparative studies of protected and unprotected areas is difficult to accomplish because of lack of available data. In this chapter, the committee reports available relevant data, but it did not examine the categories of losses reported or attempt to ensure consistency among the types of damages included in loss calculations—a step that would be necessary in a rigorous analysis of costs and benefits, but one that is beyond the scope of this study. </p><p></p><br />
