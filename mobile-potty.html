                                            There are two types of people in this world: cat people and dog people. Which type are you? Well, if you like a pet that is low maintenance, you might be a cat person. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs because cats are very independent. Since they uselitter boxes, they do not have to be taken outside to go potty like dogs. Also, cats clean themselves while dogs need occasional baths. If you prefera pet that requires more attention, you may be a dog person. Most dogs are very loyal and obedient. You can play games like fetch or tus of war with a dog. Dogs will also alert you when someone is outside of your home, whereas cats will usually just stay quiet. Both cats and dogs like to be petted, and they both make excellent pets, but it takes a certain kind of person to own them. Which kind of person are you?a. problem and solutionb. compare and contrastc. chronologicald. cause and effect e. sequence processf. persuasiong. exemplification classification​</a>

                                            Having a dog in your home can serve many purposes, but living with a poorly trained dog is not worth the mess. These mangy mutts will go potty inside of your home. This can stain your floors and make your house smell bad. In order to prevent this you have to teach your dog to go potty outside. This may require you to go on a lot more walks with your dog. You may have to sit outside for long periods of time while you are waiting for your dog to use it. But it will be worth it to not have a bunch of dog mess all over your house. So if you love your dog but hate cleaning dog-doo off of the rug, teach your dog the right way to go.

                                            Directions: Read the case below and provide a short description to complete the table. A brief background of a controversial case of a feral child found in 1970's. Genie's story came to light on November 4, 1970, in Los Angeles, California. A social worker discovered the 13-year old girl after her mother sought out services for her own health. The social worker soon discovered that the girl had been confined to a small room, and an investigation by authorities quickly revealed that the child had spent most of her life in this room, often tied to a potty chair. She spent almost her entire childhood locked in a bedroom, isolated and abused for over a decade. Genie's life prior to her discovery was one of utter deprivation. She spent most of her days tied naked to her potty chair only able to move her hands and feet. When she made noise, her father would beat her. Her father, mother, and older brother rarely spoke to her. The rare times her father did interact with her, it was to bark or growl. What do you think are the results of this situation to the 13-year old girl to her: gestures/ behavior physical appearance language used/manner of speaking reactions to people Write your short reflection here: Your Answer​</a>

There are two types of people in this world: cat people and dog people. Which type are you? Well, if you like a pet that is low maintenance, you might be a cat person.

Also, cats clean themselves while dogs need occasional baths. If you prefer a pet that requires more attention, you may be a dog person. Most dogs are very loyal and obedient. You can play games like fetch or tug of war with a dog. Dogs will also alert you when someone is outside of your home, whereas cats will usually just stay quiet. Both cats and dogs like to be petted, and they both make excellent pets, but it takes a certain kind of person to own them. Which kind of person are you? 6. What is the purpose of the factual text above? A To describe cats and dogs as pets. B. To show comparison and contrast between cats and dogs as pets. C. To tell on how to take care of cats and dogs.

                            5. There are two types of people in this world: cat people and dog people. Which type are you? Well, if you like a pet that is low maintenance, you might be a cat person. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs because cats are very independent. Since they uselitter boxes, they do not have to be taken outside to go potty like dogs. Also, cats clean themselves while dogs need occasional baths. If you prefera pet that requires more attention, you may be a dog person. Most dogs are very loyal and obedient. You can play games like fetch or tus of war with a dog. Dogs will also alert you when someone is outside of your home, whereas cats will usually just stay quiet. Both cats and dogs like to be petted, and they both make excellent pets, but it takes a certain kind of person to own them.

This can stain your floors and make your house smell bad. In order to prevent this you have to teach your dog to go potty outside. This may require you to go on a lot more walks with your dog. You may have to sit outside for long periods of time while you are waiting for your dog to use it. But it will be worth it to not have a bunch of dog mess all over your house. So if you love your dog but hate cleaning dog-doo off of the rug, teach your dog the right way to go. Problem   :Solutions:​</h2><br />

                            18. Directions: Read the case below and provide a short description to complete the table. A brief background of a controversial case of a feral child found in 1970's. Genie's story came to light on November 4, 1970, in Los Angeles, California. A social worker discovered the 13-year old girl after her mother sought out services for her own health. The social worker soon discovered that the girl had been confined to a small room, and an investigation by authorities quickly revealed that the child had spent most of her life in this room, often tied to a potty chair. She spent almost her entire childhood locked in a bedroom, isolated and abused for over a decade. Genie's life prior to her discovery was one of utter deprivation. She spent most of her days tied naked to her potty chair only able to move her hands and feet. When she made noise, her father would beat her. Her father, mother, and older brother rarely spoke to her. The rare times her father did interact with her, it was to bark or growl. What do you think are the results of this situation to the 13-year old girl to her: gestures/ behavior physical appearance language used/manner of speaking reactions to people Write your short reflection here: Your Answer​</h2><br />

She made animalistic sounds and was unable to form words or sentences.</p><p><strong>Reactions to People:</strong> Genie was initially fearful and avoided contact with people. However, she gradually learned to trust her caregivers and showed signs of attachment. She was able to interact with people using nonverbal communication.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            19. Direction. Read the text carefully. Answer the questions below. Write the letter of your answer on the blank provided. There are two types of people in this world: cat people and dog people. Which type are you? Well, if you like a pet that is low maintenance, you might be a cat person. Cats are easier to take care of than dogs because cats are very independent. Since they use litter boxes, they do not have to be taken outside to go potty like dogs. Also, cats clean themselves while dogs need occasional baths. If you prefer a pet that requires more attention, you may be a dog person. Most dogs are very loyal and obedient. You can play games like fetch or tug of war with a dog. Dogs will also alert you when someone is outside of your home, whereas cats will usually just stay quiet. Both cats and dogs like to be petted, and they both make excellent pets, but it takes a certain kind of person to own them. Which kind of person are you? 6. What is the purpose of the factual text above? A To describe cats and dogs as pets. B. To show comparison and contrast between cats and dogs as pets. C. To tell on how to take care of cats and dogs.
