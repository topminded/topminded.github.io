Activity 1: Words to Ponder Direction: Look for the definition of the following words and write it on the space provided. DEFINITION WORD Production Concept Product Concept Selling Concept Relationship Marketing Industrial Marketing Social Marketing​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Production Concept. This concept is the oldest of the concepts in business.  It holds that consumers will prefer products that are widely available and inexpensive.  Managers focusing on this concept concentrate on achieving high production efficiency, low costs, and mass distribution.  They assume that consumers are primarily interested in product availability and low prices.  This orientation makes sense in developing countries, where consumers are more interested in obtaining the product than in its features.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>            The Product Concept. This orientation holds that consumers will favor those products that offer the most quality, performance, or innovative features.  Managers focusing on this concept concentrate on making superior products and improving them over time. They assume that buyers admire well-made products and can appraise quality and performance.  However, these managers are sometimes caught up in a love affair with their product and do not realize what the market needs.  Management might commit the “better-mousetrap” fallacy, believing that a better mousetrap will lead people to beat a path to its door. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>            The Selling Concept. This is another common business orientation. It holds that consumers and businesses, if left alone, will ordinarily not buy enough of the selling company’s products.  The organization must, therefore, undertake an aggressive selling and promotion effort.  This concept assumes that consumers typically sho9w buyi8ng inertia or resistance and must be coaxed into buying.  It also assumes that the company has a whole battery of effective selling and promotional tools to stimulate more buying. Most firms practice the selling concept when they have overcapacity.  Their aim is to sell what they make rather than make what the market wants.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>            The Marketing Concept.  This is a business philosophy that challenges the above three business orientations.  Its central tenets crystallized in the 1950s.  It holds that the key to achieving its organizational goals (goals of the selling company) consists of the company being more effective than competitors in creating, delivering, and communicating customer value to its selected target customers. The marketing concept rests on four pillars:  target market, customer needs, integrated marketing and profitability.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The Societal Marketing Concept. This concept holds that the organization’s task is to determine the needs, wants, and interests of target markets and to deliver the desired satisfactions more effectively and efficiently than competitors (this is the original Marketing Concept).  Additionally, it holds that this all must be done in a way that preserves or enhances the consumer’s and the society’s well-being.</p><br />

                            28. ESSAY 1. What is the difference between traditional and contemporary marketing? 2. Provide an example of an advertisement that uses the hard sell approach and describe the content of its message, Do you think this is an effective marketing strategy? Why or why not?​</h2><br />
                        <p> </p><p>Traditional marketing and contemporary marketing are two different approaches to promoting products and services. Here are some of the main differences between the two:</p><p></p><p>1.Channels: Traditional marketing primarily uses traditional channels such as print, radio, and television ads, while contemporary marketing relies heavily on digital channels such as social media, email, and mobile marketing. </p><p></p><p>2.Audience: Traditional marketing often targets a broad audience, whereas contemporary marketing focuses on niche markets and personalized targeting.</p><p></p><p>3.Communication: Traditional marketing is often one-way communication, with the company broadcasting its message to the audience. In contrast, contemporary marketing is two-way communication, with customers engaging with the brand and providing feedback.</p><p></p><p>4.Metrics: Traditional marketing relies on metrics such as reach and frequency, while contemporary marketing uses metrics such as engagement, conversions, and return on investment (ROI).</p><p></p><p>5.Cost: Traditional marketing can be more expensive due to the cost of production and distribution of physical materials, such as billboards and print ads. In contrast, contemporary marketing can be more cost-effective due to the ability to target specific audiences and the lower cost of digital advertising.</p><p></p><p>Overall, contemporary marketing is more focused on personalization, engagement, and data-driven insights, while traditional marketing is often characterized by a broader focus and mass media channels. Both approaches can be effective, depending on the target audience, product or service, and marketing goals.</p><p></p><p></p><p>For the second question </p><p>Provide an example of an advertisement that uses the hard sell approach and describe the content of its message, Do you think this is an effective marketing strategy? Why or why not?</p><p></p><p></p><p>One example of an advertisement that uses the hard sell approach is a car commercial that highlights the vehicle's safety features and durability. The message of the ad typically revolves around the idea that the car is the safest and most reliable option on the market, and that customers who choose this car are making a smart and responsible choice for themselves and their families. The content of the message might include statistics about the car's safety ratings, testimonials from satisfied customers, and dramatic visuals of the car driving in extreme conditions or avoiding accidents. The tone of the ad is often urgent and persuasive, emphasizing the importance of making the right choice when it comes to safety and reliability.Whether or not this is an effective marketing strategy depends on a few factors. On the one hand, the hard sell approach can be effective in convincing customers to make a purchase by creating a sense of urgency and emphasizing the benefits of the product. By highlighting the safety and reliability of the car, the ad is appealing to customers who are looking for a long-term investment and are willing to pay a premium for quality.On the other hand, the hard sell approach can also be off-putting to some customers, who may feel that they are being manipulated or pressured into making a purchase. Additionally, the ad may not be effective in reaching customers who are not interested in safety and reliability as their primary concerns when choosing a car.Overall, while the hard sell approach can be effective in certain situations, it is not always the best strategy for every product or audience. Marketers should carefully consider their target audience and messaging goals before deciding whether to use a hard sell approach or another marketing strategy.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Miss q na sya super</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><br />
