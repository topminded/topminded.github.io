People nowadays, in this modern life have lost sight of what have similarities but they also have their differences. The key to opening up the world of friendship and love is. Friends do not have to be exactly the same, I mean, friends do friendship is not just to focus on the similarities but to accept each other's faults because true friends do not judge each other. Friends love unconditionally.

World Youth Day 2019 An Excerpted Pope Francis' Address At the Opening of World Youth Day "You teach us that encountering one another does not mean having to look alike or think the same way or do the same things, listening to the same music or wearing the same football jersey. No, not at all... The culture of encounter is a call inviting us to dare to keep alive a shared dream. Yes, a great dream, a dream that has a place for everyone. The dream for which Jesus gave his life on the cross, for which the Holy Spirit was poured out on the day of Pentecost and brought fire to the heart of every man and woman, in your hearts and mine, in the hope of finding room to grow and flourish.A dream named Jesus, sown by the Father in the confidence that it would grow and live in every heart. A dream running through our veins, thrilling our hearts and making them dance whenever we hear the command: "that you love one another; even as I have loved you, that you also love one another".My Relection1.

How should you express the underlined message "that you love one another; even as I have loved you, that you also love one another". of God in the text in your family, community and country?​</a>

It reminds me that I should be proud of my disability and be proud of the person I am.

                                            I am a Filipino and I love who I am. 
I eat rice with fish, vegetables, or meat; bread dipped in black coffee or coffee on rice. Meat drowned in coconut milk and made spicy with siling labuyo. 
My fellow Filipinos and I, we just love to eat. 
I dance to the rhythm of gongs, drums, and other native instruments. 
I sing love songs and lullabies. 
I sing my people’s story of sacrifice and victory. 
I can live along the river or by the sea;on mountains,valleys, and hills. 
I can also navigate my way in the city amidst tall buildings, bridges, and highways. 
My color is brown. Some of us are a little bit lighter, whiter, or darker;nevertheless we are fullblooded Filipinos. Tall, short, slim, or round, my heart faithfully beats for my homeland. 
Come to my place and I will treat you like a king or a queen. 
Meet my elders whom I address with “po” and “opo”. 
When others are in need, I will be quick to come and lead a helping hand; we call this bayanihan. 
We smile a lot. Laugh at ourselves, even at our problems, challenges, and tragedies. 
Smilling and laughing means we can rise above whatever may come to us. 
Perhaps that is because we pray a lot, we have a lot of churches, and we are not afraid to show we believe in God Almighty. 
I am a Filipino, I love my country, I love my people, my culture, and traditions. 
I am a Filipino and I love who I am.

This spiritual work of mercy is based on fraternal correction which was observed by the early Christians 2. Jesus tells us, "But I shall see you again, then your hearts will rejoice with joy no one can take from you" (Jn 16-22) 3. A truly loving Christian Community needs people to be together for better or for worse 4. Bearing wrong patiently further includes wishing for the transformation of our wrongdoers 5. Since Christ suffered for you in just this way and left you an example, so have you follow in his footsteps" peter 2:19-21) 6. Revenge is indeed dangerous although it appears sweet to those who were wronged 7. St Paul tells us "Because you are God's chosen ones, holy and beloved clothe yourself with heartfelt mercy, kindness and patience. 8 Forgive one another as the Lord has forgiven you (Col 3:12) 9. Prayer is a sign of humility and acknowledgement that God rules our lives. 10. Present your needs to God in every form of prayer and petition full of gratitude 11. Patience means waiting for the right time when to fight for justice. 12. Love is the ultimate indicator of the fulfilment of God's Kingdom 13. We care for people, it means we love them​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The figurative language used in the lyrics is:</p><p></p><p>Simile: "I'm in a field of dandelions, wishing on every one that you'll be mine, mine." - This is a simile because it uses the word "like" to compare being in a field of dandelions to the act of wishing on every one of them, implying that the person's desire for the other person is as abundant as the dandelions in the field.</p><p></p><p>Hyperbole: "And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime, and I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine." - This is a hyperbole because it exaggerates the rarity of finding true love by saying it only comes once in a lifetime, implying that the person believes the other person is their one true love.</p><p></p><p>Metaphor: "Dandelion, into the wind you go, won't you let my darling know?" - This is a metaphor because it compares a dandelion being blown by the wind to the act of conveying a message to the person's "darling." It implies that the person is hoping the message reaches their loved one just like a dandelion disperses its seeds through the wind.</p><p></p><p>Personification: "I see forever in your eyes" - This is personification because it gives human qualities, such as seeing forever, to the eyes of the person the lyrics are addressed to. It implies a deep emotional connection and suggests that the person's eyes hold a sense of eternity.</p><p></p><p>Hyperbole: "I've never felt so alive and free, when you're looking at me, I've never felt so happy." - This is a hyperbole because it exaggerates the intensity of the person's feelings when the other person is looking at them. It implies that their happiness and sense of freedom are greatly amplified in the presence of the other person.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Glad to help ^^ </p><p>pa brainly if you don't mind </p><p></p><br />

World Youth Day 2019 An Excerpted Pope Francis' Address At the Opening of World Youth Day "You teach us that encountering one another does not mean having to look alike or think the same way or do the same things, listening to the same music or wearing the same football jersey. No, not at all... The culture of encounter is a call inviting us to dare to keep alive a shared dream. Yes, a great dream, a dream that has a place for everyone. The dream for which Jesus gave his life on the cross, for which the Holy Spirit was poured out on the day of Pentecost and brought fire to the heart of every man and woman, in your hearts and mine, in the hope of finding room to grow and flourish.A dream named Jesus, sown by the Father in the confidence that it would grow and live in every heart. A dream running through our veins, thrilling our hearts and making them dance whenever we hear the command: "that you love one another; even as I have loved you, that you also love one another".My Relection1.

A truly loving Christian Community needs people to be together for better or for worse 4. Bearing wrong patiently further includes wishing for the transformation of our wrongdoers 5. Since Christ suffered for you in just this way and left you an example, so have you follow in his footsteps" peter 2:19-21) 6. Revenge is indeed dangerous although it appears sweet to those who were wronged 7. St Paul tells us "Because you are God's chosen ones, holy and beloved clothe yourself with heartfelt mercy, kindness and patience. 8 Forgive one another as the Lord has forgiven you (Col 3:12) 9. Prayer is a sign of humility and acknowledgement that God rules our lives. 10. Present your needs to God in every form of prayer and petition full of gratitude 11.

                            25. I am a Filipino and I love who I am. 
I eat rice with fish, vegetables, or meat; bread dipped in black coffee or coffee on rice. Meat drowned in coconut milk and made spicy with siling labuyo. 
My fellow Filipinos and I, we just love to eat. 
I dance to the rhythm of gongs, drums, and other native instruments. 
I sing love songs and lullabies. 
I sing my people’s story of sacrifice and victory. 
I can live along the river or by the sea;on mountains,valleys, and hills. 
I can also navigate my way in the city amidst tall buildings, bridges, and highways. 
My color is brown. Some of us are a little bit lighter, whiter, or darker;nevertheless we are fullblooded Filipinos. Tall, short, slim, or round, my heart faithfully beats for my homeland. 
Come to my place and I will treat you like a king or a queen. 
Meet my elders whom I address with “po” and “opo”. 
When others are in need, I will be quick to come and lead a helping hand; we call this bayanihan. 
We smile a lot. Laugh at ourselves, even at our problems, challenges, and tragedies. 
Smilling and laughing means we can rise above whatever may come to us. 
Perhaps that is because we pray a lot, we have a lot of churches, and we are not afraid to show we believe in God Almighty. 
I am a Filipino, I love my country, I love my people, my culture, and traditions. 
I am a Filipino and I love who I am.
