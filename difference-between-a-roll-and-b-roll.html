                            23. L. Read and encircle the correct answer.1. A boy sits halfway down a grassy slope. What force stops him sliding down?Weightc. Gravity(b Frictiond. speed2.On which surface will a toy sledge travel the furthest?a. Carpetc. Polished woodb. Iced. stone road3. Which of the following statements is true?Friction is a force that only occurs between solidsb. Friction is a force that only occurs on rough surfacesFriction is a force that only occurs when surfaces touch each otherd. Friction does not affect the movement of an object.4. If you roll two balls in two different types of floors, which ball will more likely go the furthest?a. The one in the smooth floor? c. Both of themb. The one in the rough floor?d. None of them5. Your teacher throw two sheets of paper up in the air, one is all flat out while the othercrumpled, which of the two will fall more slowly?a. The crumpled piece of paper c. They will fall at the same timeb. The flat out sheet of paperd. None of them will fall​</h2><br />
                        ANSWERS:1.) &gt;&gt; B. FrictionFriction is what makes the boy to stop from sliding down, since friction defines the resistance of motion of an moving object.<p></p>2.) &gt;&gt; B. IceObviously, the toy sledge will travel the furthest on the ice, since ice is not that prone to friction compared to the other given choices.<p></p>3.) &gt;&gt; B. Friction is a force that only occurs on rough surfacesAgain, friction is the force that stops an object from moving, and on rough surfaces this can only happen.<p></p>4.) &gt;&gt; A. The one in the smooth floorRemember, the smoother the floor is, the less friction it will have, which causes the object travel more further as long as it can be.<p></p>5.) &gt;&gt; A. The crumpled piece of paperThe resistance of air in the crumpled paper is much smaller compared to the paper that is not crampled, and that what it makes the crampled paper to fall the fastest.<p></p>#CarryOnLearning<br />
