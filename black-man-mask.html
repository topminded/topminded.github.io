Mark: Who's that man coming?)
Leon: Mark! Good morning!
Mark: Oh! Good morning too Leon! I did not recognize you since you were
wearing a hat, goggles, gloves, mask, protective clothing and boots.
Leon: Can't you recognize me when I'm wearing these?
Mark: Yes. Anyway why are you wearing those?
Leon: I am supposed to spray Malathion insecticide since black bugs attack my
rice field so that I can have a good harvest. That is also the reason why I'm
wearing these things.
Mark. Not now Leonl Let the weather calm. Look! We have strong wind we are
in signal no. 1. Don't you remember our teacher told us when we were in Grade
7-Crop Production class that spraying during strong winds causes hazard.
Leon: Sorry Mark, I was absent during that time, thank you for reminding me.
For now, I will just go home and wait for the typhoon to stop before I will spray
my rice field.
Mark: Okay, your welcome Leon. God bless. Good bye!
