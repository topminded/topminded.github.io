                                            Bata, Bata, Huwag Pabayaan ang Wikang Pambansa
by Alex Julia Buendia
Bata pa lamang ay namulat na ako sa wikang banyaga. Sa katunayan, mas
nakasanayan ko na bumilang sa Ingles kaysa sa Tagalog, lalo’t higit kapag nakikipaglaro
ng tago-taguan.
Bilang isang estudyante sa elementarya, tila mas naging importante sa akin ang
magmukhang astig sa harap ng mga kaibigan kaysa maging sugo ni Inang Wika.
Ngunit kinalaunan ay nahayag sa akin ang hirap na aking maaring kaharapin dahil sa
hindi pagiging sanay sa sariling wika. Sa pagtukoy pa lamang ng mga araw ng linggo
ay kumukunot na ang aking noo sa kadahilanang hindi ako sigurado kung aling araw
nga ba ang kahulugan ng nabanggit.
Bakit nga ba umabot pa sa puntong ang tingin sa sariling wika ay mas mababa
at naging mas madaling matutuhan ang mga salitang hindi naman atin? Kapansin-
pansin pa sa ngayon na karamihan ng mga kabataan ay mas diretso pa magsalita ng
Ingles kaysa ng Filipino. Maaring sabihing kagaya ko, nag-uugat ito sa kinagisnan ng
bata sa kaniyang pangunahing pangkat kabilang na ang impluwensiya ng pamilya at
mga malalapit na kaibigan. Maaari rin namang dahil ang Ingles ay kinikilala na opisyal
na wika rin ng Pilipinas at ginagamit bilang daluyan ng kaalaman mula samga iba’t

ibang panig ng mundo.
Ang mentalidad na ito ay nagsisilbing-diin kung bakit nararapat lamang na sa
murang edad ay sanayin ang mga kabataan na gamitin ang wikang Filipino upang lalo
nila itong bigyang kahalagahan sa kanilang paglaki. Hindi naman masama na ituro at
gamitin ang wikang Ingles, ngunit bakit parang naiwan tayong nakakulong pa rin sa
sistema ng mga mananakop? Hindi ba nararapat lamang na bigyan ng angkop na
pagpapahalaga ang sariling wika o ang wikang Filipino sa murang edad pa lamang, bago
iprayoridad ang wikang dayo?

I came right away when you called me up by phone to come and see you. MATIL: That’s nice of you Mrs. De los Reyes. FLOR: I hope you don’t mind but my last name is Caracoles. My full name really is Florencia Aragon de Caracoles. But just call me Florencia. It’s quite an honor to know you, Matilde. I’ve heard you are one of the best known society women in Manila. MATIL: Oh don’t mention it. It isn’t true, not true at all. FLOR: You’re so modest Matilde. MATIL: I was told by Marilu to get in touch with you. She said you’d surely help. FLOR: Did you say Marilu called you up? Marilu de Legazpi? Whose husband is the owner of that big department store at Buendia? MATIL: Yes. But the reason that I called you up was…FLOR: Oh well my husband bought the Legazpi’s rice fields in Pangasinan that cost us P100,000.00 but it was worth it. MATIL: That’s nice. FLOR: Well now, just how did you want me to collaborate—er—help? MATIL: It’s a benefit show we are holding to collect funds for the Sapang Palay people. You know the place? FLOR: (With a gesture of disgust). Uff, yes. Those squatters who were formerly in Intramuros. Thank God they are evicted. Can you imagine? I used to hear mass everyday at the Cathedral and whenever we passed in our Mercedes benz 600 by those streets, I felt my self-suffocating with the smells and sights of those horrible people. Uff, such disgusting squatters’ people. I couldn’t hear the mass properly and I couldn’t pray because of them. MATIL: It’s not their fault, really. After the war thousands came from the province and didn’t know where to settle.• Briefly answer the following questions:1. What do you notice in the script? 2.

In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me pieces of advice that L_ve been turning over in my mind ever since. -Whenever you feel like criticizing any one, he told me, -just remember that all the people in this world haven _t had the advantages that you _ve had. 2. Mike felt confident as ever when he started his boat engine that day. He noticed a few clouds gathering overhead, but did not worry about them. 3. Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aurellano Buendia was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice. At that time Macondo was a village of twenty adobe houses, built on the bank of a river of clear water that ran along a bed of polished stones, which were white and enormous, like prehistoric eggs. The world was so recent that many things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was necessary to point. 4. The general eyed me coldly, greeted me without fashion and dismissed me to pay my respects to his sister. It was clear that from somewhere money had been acquired. It works so well because it immediately immerses us in the world of the protagonist, begging us to ask questions, to turn the page and find out what is the story is all about. 5. The heavy coins made his pocket sag, so Alex quickly emptied the change into the table. He didn't need them for the bus since his mother was driving him to school. Later, he would be sorry he had done that​</a>

                            4. Bata, Bata, Huwag Pabayaan ang Wikang Pambansa
by Alex Julia Buendia
Bata pa lamang ay namulat na ako sa wikang banyaga. Sa katunayan, mas
nakasanayan ko na bumilang sa Ingles kaysa sa Tagalog, lalo’t higit kapag nakikipaglaro
ng tago-taguan.
Bilang isang estudyante sa elementarya, tila mas naging importante sa akin ang
magmukhang astig sa harap ng mga kaibigan kaysa maging sugo ni Inang Wika.
Ngunit kinalaunan ay nahayag sa akin ang hirap na aking maaring kaharapin dahil sa
hindi pagiging sanay sa sariling wika. Sa pagtukoy pa lamang ng mga araw ng linggo
ay kumukunot na ang aking noo sa kadahilanang hindi ako sigurado kung aling araw
nga ba ang kahulugan ng nabanggit.
Bakit nga ba umabot pa sa puntong ang tingin sa sariling wika ay mas mababa
at naging mas madaling matutuhan ang mga salitang hindi naman atin? Kapansin-
pansin pa sa ngayon na karamihan ng mga kabataan ay mas diretso pa magsalita ng
Ingles kaysa ng Filipino. Maaring sabihing kagaya ko, nag-uugat ito sa kinagisnan ng
bata sa kaniyang pangunahing pangkat kabilang na ang impluwensiya ng pamilya at
mga malalapit na kaibigan. Maaari rin namang dahil ang Ingles ay kinikilala na opisyal
na wika rin ng Pilipinas at ginagamit bilang daluyan ng kaalaman mula samga iba’t

Ikatlong Markahan: Ikatlong Linggo
ibang panig ng mundo.
Ang mentalidad na ito ay nagsisilbing-diin kung bakit nararapat lamang na sa
murang edad ay sanayin ang mga kabataan na gamitin ang wikang Filipino upang lalo
nila itong bigyang kahalagahan sa kanilang paglaki. Hindi naman masama na ituro at
gamitin ang wikang Ingles, ngunit bakit parang naiwan tayong nakakulong pa rin sa
sistema ng mga mananakop? Hindi ba nararapat lamang na bigyan ng angkop na
pagpapahalaga ang sariling wika o ang wikang Filipino sa murang edad pa lamang, bago
iprayoridad ang wikang dayo?

I came right away when you called me up by phone to come and see you. MATIL: That’s nice of you Mrs. De los Reyes. FLOR: I hope you don’t mind but my last name is Caracoles. My full name really is Florencia Aragon de Caracoles. But just call me Florencia. It’s quite an honor to know you, Matilde. I’ve heard you are one of the best known society women in Manila. MATIL: Oh don’t mention it. It isn’t true, not true at all. FLOR: You’re so modest Matilde. MATIL: I was told by Marilu to get in touch with you. She said you’d surely help. FLOR: Did you say Marilu called you up? Marilu de Legazpi? Whose husband is the owner of that big department store at Buendia? MATIL: Yes. But the reason that I called you up was…FLOR: Oh well my husband bought the Legazpi’s rice fields in Pangasinan that cost us P100,000.00 but it was worth it. MATIL: That’s nice. FLOR: Well now, just how did you want me to collaborate—er—help? MATIL: It’s a benefit show we are holding to collect funds for the Sapang Palay people. You know the place? FLOR: (With a gesture of disgust). Uff, yes. Those squatters who were formerly in Intramuros. Thank God they are evicted. Can you imagine? I used to hear mass everyday at the Cathedral and whenever we passed in our Mercedes benz 600 by those streets, I felt my self-suffocating with the smells and sights of those horrible people. Uff, such disgusting squatters’ people. I couldn’t hear the mass properly and I couldn’t pray because of them. MATIL: It’s not their fault, really. After the war thousands came from the province and didn’t know where to settle.• Briefly answer the following questions:1. What do you notice in the script? 2.
