They weremean to Cinderella, making her work all day cleaning, sewing, and cooking. She tried her best tomake them happy.Cinderella's stepmother, Lady Tremaine, was cold, cruel, and jealous of Cinderella's charmand beauty. She enjoyed giving Cinderella extra chores to do, such as Bathing her cat, Lucifer.One day, a messenger arrived with a special invitation. There was going to be a royal ball atthe palace! The King wanted his son to find a bride. Every young woman in the kingdom wasinvited—including Cinderella!Cinderella was very excited about the ball. In the attic, she found a dress that had belongedto her mother. It was a bit old-fashioned, but Cinderella could make it beautiful. Lady Tremaine didn'twant Cinderella to go the ball. She wanted the Prince to meet Anastasia and Drizella. Maybe hewould marry one of them. Lady Tremaine kept Cinderella busy with chores that would take her allnight to finish.While Cinderella was working, the mice and birds fixed her dress. They added ribbons andbeads thatv the two stepsisters had thrown away. Working together, the animals turned a simpledress into a fabulous gown! Cinderella was overjoyed when she saw the dress. Now she could goto the ball! "Oh, thank you so much!" Cinderella said to Guz, Jaq, and the birds. They ripped thedress and pulled off the beads. Lady Tremaine didn't stop them. Cinderella's dream of going to theball was throughCinderella run away to the garden to cry. Suddenly, her fairy godmother appeared. With awave of her wand, she turned a pumpkin into an elegant coach. Cinderella could now go to the ball,but her dress was still ruined. "Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!" said the Fairy Godmother, waving her wandagain. Cinderella was now wearing a beautiful gown and sparkling glass slippers. But all pof thiscame with a warning: When the clock struck midnight, the magic spell would wear off!At the ball, Prince Charming couldn't take his eyes off Cinderella. The orchestra played, andthe Prince began to dance with the wonderful girl whose name he still didn't know. For Cinderella,the night was a dream come true. Before too long, the clock began to strike midnight. "Good-bye!"Cinderella said, hurrying away."Come back!" called the Prince." I don't even know your name! As Cinderella fled, one of herglass slippers came off. Then Lady Tremaine tripped the Grand Duke, and the glass slippersshattered... but Cinderalla had other in her pocket. And if fit! Cinderella and the Prince were soonmarried. Everyone rejoined, including Cinderella's mouse ftriends, who wore special outfits to thewedding. Filled with joy, Prince Charming and Cinderella lived happily ever after.Self Check QuestionsA.

                                            Read the four types of text below and identify what makes one different from the other in terms of topic, purpose, intended audience, structure, tone, and language. Greetings from Maldives! It is my second day here, and I hope for a fun adventure! Yesterday we went snorkeling and saw some sea turtles and coral reefs. I never expected the water to be that crystal clear! Too bad I can't bring any corals home. Today, we will go dolphin spotting at Cinnamon Hakurra and do some island hopping. How's your trip going? Can't wait to see you when we get back. I wish you were here. Miss you! We are here tonight to celebrate the achievements of Mr. Mario Angeles, who has been serving our company for the past 20 years. He is a hardworking man who never failed to give a smile as he sees everyone along the halls. He is a father who is never tired of supporting his two daughters’ and son’s dreams and is successful in doing so. Mr. Angeles does not fail to be optimistic if there are problems along the way and would always cheer us up when we need it. Put three large egg yolks and finely grated parmesan cheese into a bowl. Season it with pepper and mix it well with a fork. Leave it on the side. Then, cook pancetta and crushed garlic on a medium frying pan in medium-high heat. Once the oil is rendered, remove the garlic and add cooked spaghetti and toss it over the heat. Remove the pan from the heat and add a splash of pasta water, season it with pepper, and add the egg and cheese mixture made earlier. Toss it well and add more pasta water until it looks glossy. Serve it with more parmesan cheese and cracked pepper. The problem, however, is that in interpreting and understanding literary texts, the use of one literary term or theory to focus on sometimes bring out more questions and clarifications in the text that should be answered. The tendency now is to look for more answers by looking at another theory that will answer these unclear interpretations. Then it also brings more questions, and so on. This paper aims to prove that through the use of different literary theories and various literary terms, the literary text is explored to its full potential without disrespecting the text itself and at the same time it also brings out a better appreciation of the meaning of the text read.​</a>

Walking on the Moon
When I was in Grade 3, I got to take a trip to the moon. I remember
the day like it was yesterday. It was one of the strangest experiences I’d
ever had.
It all started when Miss Reyes, our Grade 3 Science teacher, was
showing a video about the different planets in the solar system. Halfway
through the video, I noticed a sparkling metal disc, about the size of a peso
18
PIVOT 4A CALABARZON
E
coin, lying on the floor. I kept trying to pay attention to the video, but found
myself bending over to pick up the shiny disk that was next to my desk.
As soon as I touched the metal disk, something strange happened.
I wasn’t in the classroom anymore. I was hovering in the air, way above
the school. I could see the whole or rather the rooftops of the whole city.
I was a little nervous, but also pretty excited. What was happening? How
could I be floating?
It was then when I remembered the metal disk I’d picked up from
the floor earlier. Did it I have something to do with the strange things that
were happening to me right now? I opened my palm and looked closely at
the disk. On the disk were these words:
“Floating through the air, like a helium filled balloon, your travels will
not stop, until you reach the moon”
The next thing I knew, I was soaring through space, dodging
satellites and asteroids. Oddly enough, I wasn’t cold and I was able to
breathe just fine. Before I knew it, I was standing on the moon. It was
amazing! It looked very different from the Earth. No trees, water, nor
houses. There wasn’t even any wind .
For each step I took I would bounce way up into the air. Every step
took left a huge footprint in the dust. I had to be careful and make sure
I didn’t jump into a crater because I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to get
out. Sometimes I couldn’t even see the bottom. I was bounding over to
something in the distance that looked very out of the place. When I got
there, I realized it was a flag. On the flag were the words: “To go to Earth,
close your eyes and think of what you’ve learned. You will find in no time at
all, you will be returned”. I wasn’t sure I wanted to go back just yet, but
I knew it might get dark soon and I didn’t want to be on the moon by
myself in the dark. I decided to close my eyes and think of the weather and
other characteristics of the moon I’d learned that day.
When I opened my eyes I was sitting on my seat in my Science
classroom. Miss Reyes was turning on the lights because the video was
over. I sat there wondering about what just happened. I opened my hand to
look at the metal disk, but it was gone! Did I really take a trip to the moon
or was it just a dream?
1. Where is the setting of the story?
a. Saturn b. outer space c. a town d. a Science classroom
2. In the sentence, “ I was hovering in the air, way above the school” what
does the word hovering mean?
a. floating b. dreaming c. walking d. jumping
3. Why are the words “Floating through the air, like a helium filled balloon,
your travels will not stop, until you reach the moon” written in italics?
a. The teacher thinks they are important.
b. They are words the student says.
c. They are words from the video.
d. The words on the disk are important.

She enjoyed giving Cinderella extra chores to do, such as Bathing her cat, Lucifer.One day, a messenger arrived with a special invitation. There was going to be a royal ball atthe palace! The King wanted his son to find a bride. Every young woman in the kingdom wasinvited—including Cinderella!Cinderella was very excited about the ball.

She wanted the Prince to meet Anastasia and Drizella. Maybe hewould marry one of them. Lady Tremaine kept Cinderella busy with chores that would take her allnight to finish.While Cinderella was working, the mice and birds fixed her dress. They added ribbons andbeads thatv the two stepsisters had thrown away. Working together, the animals turned a simpledress into a fabulous gown! Cinderella was overjoyed when she saw the dress. Now she could goto the ball! "Oh, thank you so much!" Cinderella said to Guz, Jaq, and the birds. They ripped thedress and pulled off the beads. Lady Tremaine didn't stop them. Cinderella's dream of going to theball was throughCinderella run away to the garden to cry. Suddenly, her fairy godmother appeared. With awave of her wand, she turned a pumpkin into an elegant coach. Cinderella could now go to the ball,but her dress was still ruined. "Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!" said the Fairy Godmother, waving her wandagain.

Greetings from Maldives! It is my second day here, and I hope for a fun adventure! Yesterday we went snorkeling and saw some sea turtles and coral reefs. I never expected the water to be that crystal clear! Too bad I can't bring any corals home. Today, we will go dolphin spotting at Cinnamon Hakurra and do some island hopping. How's your trip going? Can't wait to see you when we get back. I wish you were here. Miss you! We are here tonight to celebrate the achievements of Mr. Mario Angeles, who has been serving our company for the past 20 years. He is a hardworking man who never failed to give a smile as he sees everyone along the halls. He is a father who is never tired of supporting his two daughters’ and son’s dreams and is successful in doing so. Mr. Angeles does not fail to be optimistic if there are problems along the way and would always cheer us up when we need it. Put three large egg yolks and finely grated parmesan cheese into a bowl. Season it with pepper and mix it well with a fork. Leave it on the side. Then, cook pancetta and crushed garlic on a medium frying pan in medium-high heat. Once the oil is rendered, remove the garlic and add cooked spaghetti and toss it over the heat. Remove the pan from the heat and add a splash of pasta water, season it with pepper, and add the egg and cheese mixture made earlier. Toss it well and add more pasta water until it looks glossy. Serve it with more parmesan cheese and cracked pepper. The problem, however, is that in interpreting and understanding literary texts, the use of one literary term or theory to focus on sometimes bring out more questions and clarifications in the text that should be answered. The tendency now is to look for more answers by looking at another theory that will answer these unclear interpretations. Then it also brings more questions, and so on. This paper aims to prove that through the use of different literary theories and various literary terms, the literary text is explored to its full potential without disrespecting the text itself and at the same time it also brings out a better appreciation of the meaning of the text read.​</h2><br />

Walking on the Moon
When I was in Grade 3, I got to take a trip to the moon. I remember
the day like it was yesterday. It was one of the strangest experiences I’d
ever had.
It all started when Miss Reyes, our Grade 3 Science teacher, was
showing a video about the different planets in the solar system. Halfway
through the video, I noticed a sparkling metal disc, about the size of a peso
18
PIVOT 4A CALABARZON
E
coin, lying on the floor. I kept trying to pay attention to the video, but found
myself bending over to pick up the shiny disk that was next to my desk.
As soon as I touched the metal disk, something strange happened.
I wasn’t in the classroom anymore. I was hovering in the air, way above
the school. I could see the whole or rather the rooftops of the whole city.
I was a little nervous, but also pretty excited. What was happening? How
could I be floating?
It was then when I remembered the metal disk I’d picked up from
the floor earlier. Did it I have something to do with the strange things that
were happening to me right now? I opened my palm and looked closely at
the disk. On the disk were these words:
“Floating through the air, like a helium filled balloon, your travels will
not stop, until you reach the moon”
The next thing I knew, I was soaring through space, dodging
satellites and asteroids. Oddly enough, I wasn’t cold and I was able to
breathe just fine. Before I knew it, I was standing on the moon. It was
amazing! It looked very different from the Earth. No trees, water, nor
houses. There wasn’t even any wind .
For each step I took I would bounce way up into the air. Every step
took left a huge footprint in the dust. I had to be careful and make sure
I didn’t jump into a crater because I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to get
out. Sometimes I couldn’t even see the bottom. I was bounding over to
something in the distance that looked very out of the place. When I got
there, I realized it was a flag. On the flag were the words: “To go to Earth,
close your eyes and think of what you’ve learned. You will find in no time at
all, you will be returned”. I wasn’t sure I wanted to go back just yet, but
I knew it might get dark soon and I didn’t want to be on the moon by
myself in the dark. I decided to close my eyes and think of the weather and
other characteristics of the moon I’d learned that day.
When I opened my eyes I was sitting on my seat in my Science
classroom. Miss Reyes was turning on the lights because the video was
over. I sat there wondering about what just happened. I opened my hand to
look at the metal disk, but it was gone! Did I really take a trip to the moon
or was it just a dream?

a. Saturn b. outer space c. a town d. a Science classroom
2. In the sentence, “ I was hovering in the air, way above the school” what
does the word hovering mean?

b. They are words the student says.
c. They are words from the video.
d. The words on the disk are important.
