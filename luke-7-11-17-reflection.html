And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:</p><p></p><p>7 Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.</p><p></p><p>8 For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.</p><p></p><p>9 When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</p><p></p><p>10 And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.</p><p></p><p>11 And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.</p><p></p><p>12 Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.</p><p></p><p>13 And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.</p><p></p><p>14 And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.</p><p></p><p>15 And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.</p><p></p><p>16 And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.</p><p></p><p>17 And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.</p><p></p><p>18 And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.</p><p></p><p>19 And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</p><p></p><p>20 When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</p><p></p><p>21 And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight.</p><p></p><p>22 Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.</p><p></p><p>23 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</p><p></p><p>24 And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see?

No gray sunglasses for what it means. Those who are more financially strong should understand that attending  church council once a week is not always enough. The alms that Christ spoke of also included constant prayer, God's reward, concern for others, love and religion, and the grace to purify any vices that might exist in him. Giving alms without hope will again produce grace that protects us from distractions and longing for greatness.</p><p>God could be very trustworthy to all of us, and way to His faithfulness  we are able to retain to stay as His little kids on this world. For our part, we should attempt to be as trustworthy as viable to Him who loves us.</p><p>To love God approach to present all we should Him. Loving our neighbor as ourselves is handiest feasible if we provide ourselves absolutely to Him. The key to pleasant His command to like God and love our neighbor is handiest feasible thru overall surrender..</p><p>In short, the 2 commandments of God's love  and love of  neighbor are inseparable, one  can not be fulfilled with out the other, due to the fact whoever loves God loves man, his children.</p><br />

                        <p>Lectio divina is an authentic source of Christian spirituality recommended by our Rule. We therefore practice it every day, so that we may develop a deep and genuine love for it, and so that we may grow in the surpassing knowledge of Christ. In this way we shall put into practice the Apostle Paul’s commandment, which is mentioned in our Rule: “Let the sword of the spirit, the Word of God, live abundantly in your mouth and in your hearts; and whatever you must do, do it in the name of the Lord.</p><br /><br />

                            22. reflection about luke 6:17 -26​</h2><br />
                        <p>Today we begin what is known as Luke’s ‘Sermon on the Plain’ which more or less parallels Matthew’s Sermon on the Mount. Luke’s is much shorter but both begin with the Beatitudes and end with the parable of the house builders. Some of what is found in Matthew’s Sermon is found elsewhere in Luke as Matthew’s ‘Sermon’ it consists of disparate sayings of Jesus gathered into one place. Luke also omits Matthew’s specifically Jewish material which would not have been relevant to his Gentile readers.
</p><p>
</p><p>The Sermon can be summarised as follows:
</p><p>
</p><p>An introduction of blessings and woes (20-26)
</p><p>
</p><p>The love of one’s enemies (27-36)
</p><p>
</p><p>The demands of loving one’s neighbour (37-42)
</p><p>
</p><p>Good deeds as proof of one’s goodness (43-45)
</p><p>
</p><p>A parable on listening to and acting on the words of Jesus (46-49).
</p><p>
</p><p>Similar to Matthew’s Sermon on the Mount, Luke begins the Sermon on the Plain with his version of the Beatitudes. But there are striking differences. Whereas Matthew has eight (some would say seven) Beatitudes, Luke has four “Blesseds” and four contrasting “Woes”. As is typical of his uncompromising style when it comes to following Jesus, the language of Luke is much more direct and hard-hitting and it may well be closer to what Jesus actually said.
</p><p>
</p><p>Matthew’s Beatitudes propose a set of attitudes which reflect the spirit of the Kingdom, qualities to be found in the truly Christian and human life. Luke, on the other hand, speaks of material conditions in this life which will be overturned. Later in this gospel, this is illustrated graphically in the story of the rich man and Lazarus (16:25).
</p><p>
</p><p>Luke also has Jesus speak in the second person: “Blessed are you” and “Woe to you” rather than in the third person as Matthew does (“Blessed are those who…”). Nor does he speak of the “poor in spirit” but of “you who are poor” and he certainly means the materially poor.
</p><p>
</p><p>He goes on to say how blessed too are “you who are hungry; you who weep; you who are hated and who are rejected and marginalised and whose name is regarded as evil” because of their connection with Jesus. Undoubtedly Matthew’s Beatitudes can be read to consider just ‘spiritual’ poverty and a hunger for ‘righteousness’, which in fact are also a form of real poverty and real hunger but Luke is a gospel for the materially poor and distressed and we must be careful not to turn our focus away from them. That is why he has Jesus born in poverty and dying naked and destitute (even of his ‘friends’).
</p><p>
</p><p>Jesus tells those who are poor and hungry and abused to rejoice when that happens and “dance for joy”. There are two reasons:
</p><p>
</p><p>because their reward will be “great in heaven” and
</p><p>
</p><p>because that is the way the prophets in the past were treated (and the way Jesus the Prophet will also be treated).
</p><p>
</p><p>At a first reading, it seems like a classical example of religion as the ‘opium of the people’: Be happy that you are having such a hard time now because there is a wonderful future waiting for you in the next world. It was the message that Karl Marx mocked the capitalist-ruled churches of preaching to the exploited ‘proletariat’.
</p><p>
</p><p>And the second part is not likely to go down well in our contemporary developed world. “”Woe to you who are rich [he can’t be serious!], you have received your comfort already.” “Woe to you who are full, because you will be hungry; woe to you who laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep; woe to you who are spoken well of. That is how they treated the false prophets.”
</p><p>
</p><p>How are we to understand these sayings which turn our common worldview upside down? I think they have to be seen in the light of the Kingdom, in the kind of society that Jesus came to set up, a society based on mutual love and sharing and support. A Kingdom for this world and not just the next. The coming of such a society could only be good news for the poor and destitute (material and otherwise), for those suffering from hunger (physical and otherwise), for those depressed by deep sorrow and for those abused and rejected for their commitment to Jesus and his Way.
</p><p>
</p><p>On the other hand it would not be good news for those self-focused people who amass material wealth at the expense of others, who indulge in excessive consumption of the world’s goods, who live lives centred on personal hedonism and pleasure, and who feed off the envy and adulation of those around them. There is really no place for such people in the Kingdom. To enter fully into the Kingdom they have to unload all these concerns and obsessions and let go. Instead of focusing on what they can get; they will focus on what they can share of what they have.
</p><p>
</p><p>A clear example is of the rich young man in the Gospel. How rich he was – and yet how sad he was! Compare him with Zacchaeus, whom we will be meeting later on.</p><p></p><br />

                            23. Summary of Luke 5:1-11 with 2-3 sentences reflection (English)</h2><br />
                        <p>Summary of Luke 5:1-11 states that there was once a group of fishermen who have been trying to catch fish the whole night but they are not able to catch anything. Jesus commanded them to put their nets on the deep water but Simon doubted about Jesus command but he said "because you said so Lord, I will let down the nets. He put down the nets and in their surprised they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break. The moral of this lesson is that nothing is impossible with Jesus Christ. He can do all things what we need to do is just to trust everything to him. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The Word of God
</p><p>The seventy returned with joy, saying, 'Lord, in your name even the demons submit to us!' He said to them, 'I watched Satan fall from heaven like a flash of lightning. See, I have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing will hurt you. Nevertheless, do not rejoice at this, that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.'
</p><p>Jesus Rejoices At that same hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, 'I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants; yes, Father, for such was your gracious will. All things have been handed over to me by my Father; and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, or who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.'
</p><p>Then turning to the disciples, Jesus said to them privately, 'Blessed are the eyes that see what you see! For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, but did not see it, and to hear what you hear, but did not hear it.'

                            29. Reflection Luke 1, 7-14​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In Luke 14:1, 7-14, the social matrix of first-century life is on display, and we hear Jesus speak into this matrix both with communal wisdom and unexpected, even astonishing, advice. We hear the setting for the story in 14:1. It is the Sabbath, and Jesus is invited to a meal at the house of a leading Pharisee. After an interlude in which Luke narrates Jesus healing a man and defending that Sabbath healing, Luke focuses on the meal scene, a setting he strategically employs in his gospel (e.g., 5:29; 7:36; 11:37; see also 7:34; 15:1-2).Jesus observes "how the guests chose the places of honor" during the meal (14:7). According to Luke, his response is twofold. He begins by telling a parable. The story's point is to discourage his audience from seeking the most prestigious seat at the table (prtoklisia) in order to avoid the humiliating situation of being displaced by someone of greater prominence (14:8). Instead, they are to take the lowest seat so that their host can elevate them to a more honorable seat (14:10). The well-known aphorism is Jesus' summary comment to the parable: "For all who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted" (14:11).</p><br />

                        GOSPEL LUKE 5:1-11 REFLECTION<p>In Luke’s Gospel, <strong>Jesus</strong> said to Simon, “Put out into deep water and lower your nets for a catch”. Simon was hesitant and doubted <strong>Jesus</strong>. But when they had done what <strong>Jesus</strong> told them, they caught a great number of fish and their nets were tearing. When they brought their boats to the shore, they left everything and followed Him.</p><p></p>REFLECTION<p>This Gospel provides a wealth of insight into how ordinary people are called to mission and discipleship by God. After all, Simon Peter and his fishing companions aren't anything out of the norm. They are ordinary fishermen who are merely going about their daily business. When Jesus shows up, he enters their entirely routine, boring lives and alters everything, they are minding their own business, cleaning their nets after a long, particularly dismal night of work. Human sin, failure, and incompetence are not impediments to God's call, as we find throughout Scripture.</p><p>How difficult is it for us to submit to the one who gave his life for our sake? "Do not be scared; from now on you will be catching men," Jesus always reminds us. We are always afraid of what will happen to us since it is already embedded in our thoughts that what we do today will effect our future. We tend to forget that Jesus is waiting and hoping that we can still submit ourselves to him and God's plan since we are continuously fighting for the demands and standards of life. Today's Gospel reminds us that being a Christian is a calling and a task that we face every day. Always keep in mind the teachings of Christ.</p><p>We are all called to participate in God's mission to the world in Jesus Christ as a result of our baptism. In order to match our priorities with God's, we must daily re-orient our priorities in order to use the gifts God has given us to serve others, and to spread the Good News of Christ in word and deed.</p><p></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/8630930</p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
