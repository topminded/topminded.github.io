                                            D Geom magnetic field is vertical Magnetic North Pole it is the point that a magnetic compass point to it is presently located Canadian Territorial waters. west of Greenland. It is slowly moving in a north-westerly direction w the Arctic Ocean. It is estimated that it is moving at a speed of about 40 kilometers per year and o the last century the Magnetic Pole has moved a remarkable 1100 kilometers ✓ Magnetic South Pole - magnetic, but this is very weak and hard to identify even if you are near it, as a result magnetic compasses rarely point to the South Magnetic Pole. E. Time Zones - a region where the same standard time is used. Using zones of longitude which were 15" wide, it divides the Earth into 24 time zones (one for each hour of the day) which was done by Canadian Sir Sanford Fleming in 1878. To the east time progressively became later in a day and to the west time progressively became earlier in a day. This resulted in the creation of an interesting phenomenon at the 180° line of longitude - the International Date Line (IDL). Figure 2.

It is slowly moving in a north-westerly direction w the Arctic Ocean. It is estimated that it is moving at a speed of about 40 kilometers per year and o the last century the Magnetic Pole has moved a remarkable 1100 kilometers ✓ Magnetic South Pole - magnetic, but this is very weak and hard to identify even if you are near it, as a result magnetic compasses rarely point to the South Magnetic Pole. E. Time Zones - a region where the same standard time is used. Using zones of longitude which were 15" wide, it divides the Earth into 24 time zones (one for each hour of the day) which was done by Canadian Sir Sanford Fleming in 1878. To the east time progressively became later in a day and to the west time progressively became earlier in a day. This resulted in the creation of an interesting phenomenon at the 180° line of longitude - the International Date Line (IDL). Figure 2.
