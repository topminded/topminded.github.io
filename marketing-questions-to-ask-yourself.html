                                            THE SIXTH COMMANDMENT Mrs. Santos was a widow who was left with three young boys to take care of. Her husband had left her with a very meager savings not enough to bring up their children comfortably and decently. To the best of her ability, she tried to raise them in a God-fearing home. She worked hard by washing clothes and selling rice cakes in the neighborhood. She tried to save too for the rainy days. Mrs. Santos had trouble with one of her sons. He always find the secret places where she hid her money and would take from it the amount he wanted. This happened several times and no amount of scolding or punishment could change the boy. Finally, in desperation, the mother got a piece of paper and printed on it in bold letters, "Thou shalt not steal." Placing it on top of the box which contained the money, she hid it in a new place. Again, the boy found the box where the money was kept. He saw and read the piece of paper with The Sixth Commandment written on it. The good within him prevailed over his mischief. He shuddered at the thought that he would again be breaking God's commandment. He laid down the box without opening it and left feeling guilty for his past deeds. A few days later, upon returning from the market, the mother noticed that the box had again been found. Everything inside it, however, was intact. Not a centavo was missing. "Incredibly true, everything accounted for," she mused. The boy saw his mother examining the box. Quickly he approached her, knelt down before her, and begged for forgiveness. The mother was touched by the boy's act of repentance. She told him, "My son, I know that God within you will not allow you to do such a thing. Your good self will always prevail over your folly. From now on, always think several times before doing something. Ask yourself, "Will I be breaking one of God's commandments?" By living up to God's commandment you can never go wrong."Questions:1. What was Mrs. Santos' problem?2. Describe the sixth commandment.3. How did the son ask for forgiveness?4. Aside from washing clothes, how else did Mrs. Santos earn some money?5. What kind of a mother is Mrs. Santos?6. How do you think will her sons grow up?7. What advice can you give to the kids who go against the sixth commandment?​</a>

                                            The Lazy Farmer? The rain gods had been smiling the whole night. The roads were muddy and the potholes were filled to the brim. It was the day for the market and Raju the farmer was riding his cart along the country road. He had to reach the market early so that he can sell his hay. It was very difficult for the horses to drag the load through the deep mud. On his journey suddenly the wheels of the horse cart sank into the mire. The more the horses pulled, the deeper the wheel sank. Raju climbed down from his seat and stood beside his cart. He searched all around but could not find anyone around to help him. Cursing his bad luck, he looked dejected and defeated. He didn't make the slightest effort to get down on the wheel and lift it up by himself. Instead, he started cursing his luck for what happened. Looking up at the sky, he started shouting at God, "I am so unlucky! Why has this happened to me? Oh God, come down to help me." After a long wait, God finally appeared before Raju. He asked Raju, "Do you think you can move the chariot by simply looking at it and whining about it? Nobody will help you unless you make some effort to help yourself. Did you try to get the wheel out of the pothole by yourself? Get up and put your shoulder to wheel and you will soon find the way out." Raju was ashamed of himself. He bent down and put his shoulder to the wheel and urged on the horses. In no time the wheel was out of the mire. Raju learned his lesson. He thanked God and carried on his journey happily. Moral: God helps those who help themselves. Activity 1 Questions: 1. Who are the characters in the story? 2. Who is Raju? 3. Where did the story take place? 4. What problem did Raju meet? 5.

                            4. THE SIXTH COMMANDMENT Mrs. Santos was a widow who was left with three young boys to take care of. Her husband had left her with a very meager savings not enough to bring up their children comfortably and decently. To the best of her ability, she tried to raise them in a God-fearing home. She worked hard by washing clothes and selling rice cakes in the neighborhood. She tried to save too for the rainy days. Mrs. Santos had trouble with one of her sons. He always find the secret places where she hid her money and would take from it the amount he wanted. This happened several times and no amount of scolding or punishment could change the boy. Finally, in desperation, the mother got a piece of paper and printed on it in bold letters, "Thou shalt not steal." Placing it on top of the box which contained the money, she hid it in a new place. Again, the boy found the box where the money was kept. He saw and read the piece of paper with The Sixth Commandment written on it. The good within him prevailed over his mischief. He shuddered at the thought that he would again be breaking God's commandment. He laid down the box without opening it and left feeling guilty for his past deeds. A few days later, upon returning from the market, the mother noticed that the box had again been found. Everything inside it, however, was intact. Not a centavo was missing. "Incredibly true, everything accounted for," she mused. The boy saw his mother examining the box. Quickly he approached her, knelt down before her, and begged for forgiveness. The mother was touched by the boy's act of repentance. She told him, "My son, I know that God within you will not allow you to do such a thing. Your good self will always prevail over your folly. From now on, always think several times before doing something. Ask yourself, "Will I be breaking one of God's commandments?" By living up to God's commandment you can never go wrong."Questions:1. What was Mrs. Santos' problem?2. Describe the sixth commandment.3. How did the son ask for forgiveness?4. Aside from washing clothes, how else did Mrs. Santos earn some money?5. What kind of a mother is Mrs. Santos?6. How do you think will her sons grow up?7. What advice can you give to the kids who go against the sixth commandment?​</h2><br />

                            11. The Lazy Farmer? The rain gods had been smiling the whole night. The roads were muddy and the potholes were filled to the brim. It was the day for the market and Raju the farmer was riding his cart along the country road. He had to reach the market early so that he can sell his hay. It was very difficult for the horses to drag the load through the deep mud. On his journey suddenly the wheels of the horse cart sank into the mire. The more the horses pulled, the deeper the wheel sank. Raju climbed down from his seat and stood beside his cart. He searched all around but could not find anyone around to help him. Cursing his bad luck, he looked dejected and defeated. He didn't make the slightest effort to get down on the wheel and lift it up by himself. Instead, he started cursing his luck for what happened. Looking up at the sky, he started shouting at God, "I am so unlucky! Why has this happened to me? Oh God, come down to help me." After a long wait, God finally appeared before Raju. He asked Raju, "Do you think you can move the chariot by simply looking at it and whining about it? Nobody will help you unless you make some effort to help yourself. Did you try to get the wheel out of the pothole by yourself? Get up and put your shoulder to wheel and you will soon find the way out." Raju was ashamed of himself. He bent down and put his shoulder to the wheel and urged on the horses. In no time the wheel was out of the mire. Raju learned his lesson. He thanked God and carried on his journey happily. Moral: God helps those who help themselves. Activity 1 Questions: 1. Who are the characters in the story? 2. Who is Raju? 3. Where did the story take place? 4. What problem did Raju meet? 5.

The man said, “Aren’t you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey with you and your son?”The man and the boy got off and tried to think about what to do.

</strong></p><p><strong>Answer: As a Grade 10 student, I will set an example for them by only using safe and proven health products and do a research about the product if they can cause irritation to your skin or an allergic reaction. I can also advise them and tell them what to do if buying products especially for skin or how to avoid skin reactions to beauty products like whitening and raise awareness about labels putted in beauty products just because a label says something is "hypoallergenic," "dermatologist tested," "sensitivity tested," or "non-irritating," that's no guarantee that the products will be kind to your skin. Some companies do the testing, others don't. There are no rules about how these terms can be used on a label. </strong></p><p><strong>Hope It helps </strong></p><br />

Can things be done better, cheaper, faster, and cleaner? Can a product used for a specific purpose be also used for some other purposes? Market, ways of generating business ideas,​</h2><br />

The Old Man, His Son, and a DonkeyA man and his son were once going with their donkey to market.As they were walking along by its side, they passed a group of women, one of whom said, “You fools, what is aDonkey for but to ride upon?  So the man put the boy on the donkey and went on their way. But soon they passed a group of men, one of whom said, “See that lazy boy, he lets his father walk while he rides.”So the man ordered his boy to get off and got on himself. But they hadn’t far when they passed three women, one of whom said to the other, “Shame on that lazy old  man to let his poor little son walk along.”  Well, the man didn’t know what to do, but at last, he took his Boy up before him on the donkey. By this time they had come to the town, and the passerby began to tease and point at them. The man stopped and asked why. The man said, “Aren’t you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey with you and your son?”The man and the boy got off and tried to think about what to do. They thought and they thought, till at last, they cut down a pole tied the donkey’s feet to it, and raised the pole and the donkey to their shoulders. They went along in the middle of the laughter of all who met them till they came to Market Bridge. The donkey, getting one of his feet loose, kicked out and caused the boy to drop his end of the pole. In the struggle, the donkey fell over the bridge, and with his feet tied together, he drowned. “That will teach you,” said an old man who had followed them: “Please all, and you will please none.”Answer the following questions:1.
