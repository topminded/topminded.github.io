It can also disturb rivers andlakes to a possibly lethal level.6. Each species has defense mechanisms like immunitiesand the ability to fight disease. With the changing climateand landscape certain species are losing their ability tofend off disease. They are becoming more susceptible todisease and epidemics, which can lead to their eventualextinction.7. The biodiversity Earth can't keep up with the rapid chang-es in temperature and climate. The species are not used tosevere weather conditions and long seasons.8. This is the result of melting freshwater. The denser, saltierwater sinks and forms the currents that marine life de-pends on.

Footing is part of the foundation, 3. The topography of the surface does not affect the type and design of foundation, 4. For the building to last, its foundation should be designed for the worst times. 5. It is in pier foundation where concrete piers are carried down through the soil of inadequate bearing power until a satisfactory foundation bed is reached. 6. The portion of the foundation which directly distributes the weight of a building over large area is the column. 7. The foundation must be strong enough to support and distribute the load of the structure. 8. To anticipate the need for stepped footings, retaining walls, and problems related to the grade of the land, the plot plan and elevation plan drawings should also be examined. 9. The first thing to do in drafting foundation plan is to draw outlines of footings and columns based on accepted architectural drawing practices.10.

The man kicked and threw the poor cat out of his house. __ 4. There was plenty of food, and the music was playing. Everybody was having a good time. __ 5. He approached the task with sheer determination. He had studied his plans carefully, spent hours preparing and was sure of his approach. The hours he spent practicing were grueling and exhausting but he was ready. This was the year he would win the poster-making contest at school. __ 6. The night it happened was one we will never forget. The wind was screeching outside as rain pounded against the window. We had lost electricity hours ago and had nothing but candles to light the house. The battery powered radio we had was broadcasting a warning to lock your doors and stay inside. __ 7. The gym of the high school was brightly decorated. The red and white streamers covered the walls and heart shapes were scattered all over the floor. Red glitter was thrown on all the tables and love songs were playing in the background. The Valentine’s dance was about to begin.  __ 8. The door swings open to reveal a Christmas tree, alone in the middle of the room, sparkling with hundreds of lights. Silence greets me as I glance around the room. The fireplace is empty and the snowstorm howls outside the window. My family has gone and I am left alone with my thoughts.  __ 9. Lola sat on the old, lumpy couch crying. She could let it all out here, alone in her mother’s small, quiet apartment. The familiar walls were covered in rose pink wallpaper. Goldie, her mother’s eleventh fish, seemed to stare sympathetically at Lola through the fishbowl sitting on the counter. The smell of her mother’s vanilla candles comforted her aching heart. __  10.  There  is  no  one That  can  be  better Because  you  are  brilliant. There  is  nothing That  you  cannot  you  do Because  you  are  unbeatabl e.

To anticipate the need for stepped footings, retaining walls, and problems related to the grade of the land, the plot plan and elevation plan drawings should also be examined. 9.

Climatic Heating and Cooling B. Changes in Sea Lev- els or Currents C. Asteroids / Cosmic Radiation Column B 1. From John W. Williams' research, their findings indicated that "By the end of the 21st century, large portions of the Earth's surface may experience climates not found at pre- sent and some 21st century climates may disappear. 2. Habitat loss and degradation affect 86% of all threatened birds, 86% of mammals and 88% of threatened amphibi- ans. D. Acid Rain E. Disease / Epidemic F. Spread of Invasive Species G. Human Causes of Extinction H. Habitat Degradation 1. Climate Change and 5. This forms when sulfur dioxide and / or nitrogen oxides Global Warming are put into the atmosphere. Increases the acidity of the soil which affects plant life. It can also disturb rivers and lakes to a possibly lethal level. 3. Increase in population, destruction/fragmentation of habi- tat, pollution and climate change/global warming 4. They use resources that the other species depend on. Once competition gets too great, the survival of the fittest plan will begin, and one of the species, usually the natural one, will die off. 6. Each species has defense mechanisms like immunities and the ability to fight disease. With the changing climate and landscape certain species are losing their ability to fend off disease. They are becoming more susceptible to disease and epidemics, which can lead to their eventual extinction. 7. The biodiversity Earth can't keep up with the rapid chang- es in temperature and climate. The species are not used to severe weather conditions and long seasons. 8. This is the result of melting freshwater. The denser, saltier water sinks and forms the currents that marine life de- pends on. Ocean floor spreading and rising also affects sea level. 9. The reverberations of their impact to Earth can be felt around the world. The impact site is completely destroyed. Radiation is being emitted from outer space and the sun. A supernova remnant is one source of cosmic radiation​</h2><br />
