                            1. This element of a research paper is often shown in tables or figures.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p> Using tables and figures in research papers is essential for the paper’s readability. The reader is given a chance to understand data through visual content. When writing a research paper, these elements should be considered as part of good research writing. APA research papers, MLA research papers, and other manuscripts require visual content if the data is too complex or voluminous. The importance of tables and graphs is underscored by the main purpose of writing, and that is to be understood.<p></p><p></p><p>correct me if I'm wrong.</p><br />

Having figures and tables on research paper can help you organize your data and simplify it in the result section b). tables and figures should be placed at the end of the table before the reference. (letter of the correct answer)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The correct statement is (a) Having figures and tables on research paper can help you organize your data and simplify it in the result section. </p><p></p><p>Including figures and tables in a research paper can make it easier for readers to understand the information being presented, as they can visually see patterns and trends in the data. These elements can also help to simplify the results section of a paper by presenting complex data in a clear and concise manner. </p><p></p><p>However, it is generally recommended to place tables and figures close to where they are first mentioned in the text, rather than at the end of the paper. This allows readers to easily refer to the relevant information while reading the paper. Therefore, statement (b) is not correct.</p><br />

                            3. Write TRUE if the statement is correct and FALSE if the statement is incorrect. 1. In the result section, the data gathered can be presented using figures and tables only.2. Duplication of the data in words with that presented in figures and tables should be avoided.3. The data should be reported as Mean, SD beside with the levels of significance.4. The result section can be started with the sentence instead of tables and figures5. Numbers presented in a table (or in a figure) should be repeated in the text.6. The discussion is a vital part of the paper and begins with the summary of the research problem that has been addressed in the article. 7. The negative findings should also be described along with the possible reasons.8. Only positive findings are important. 9.
