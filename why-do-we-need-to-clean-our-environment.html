It will promote a clean and healthy environment to live in. The rubbish we throw away everyday can creates waste. Recycling means that there is less rubbish, which makes our environment cleaner and healthier Besides recycling saves raw materials. The more we recycle the few raw materials we need. Definitely, it can help to save wild places and the animals that they live in them. Recycling papers, for example means that fewer timber forests are needed As stewards of the environment we are responsible for preserving and protecting our resources. We should take care our environment not only for ourselves but for future generations. Based on the reasons stated above. I believe that recycling is really important to be done now.

Use the graphic organizer below. Do this activity in your English notebook. Recycling, why is it important? Recycling is important to be done. It will promote a clean and healthy environment to live in. The rubbish we throw away everyday can creates waste. Recycling means that there is less rubbish, which makes our environment cleaner and healthier. Besides, recycling saves raw materials. The more we recycle, the few raw materials we need. Definitely, it can help to save wild places and the animals that they live in them. Recycling papers, for example, means that fewer timber forests are needed. As stewards of the environment, we are responsible for preserving and protecting our resources. We should take care our environment not only for ourselves but for future generations. Based on the reasons stated above, I believe that recycling is really important to be done now. Topic: High Modality Words: Language of Opinion:​</a>

                                            Mother Nature
Glassy and clear waters in the oceans and seas,
Blue skies with cotton puffs of white clouds on the breeze,
Mangroves and sea grass meadows in sparkling dew,
Fresh air touching one’s soul in calming view,
Such are wonderful gifts of our Mother Nature.
But population bursts with some humans selfish and cruel,
Urban and industrial development changed mother nature,
Breaking her heart with sorrow and pain,
Overharvesting marine species for more gain,
Dredging of sand done and no one seems to care.
Clean sands covered with shattered trash thrown in hastes,
Clear water turns dark with improperly disposed wastes,
Dynamite fishing makes aquatic species weep,
Excessive use of chemicals households do keep,
Air we breathe is exhausting, it isn’t fair.
Destructions of man must come to end,
For nature’s revenge is cruel and hard to mend,
Take care of the environment providing our needs,
Start now, correct the wrong ways and deeds,
Take part! Conserve and protect our mother nature.

It will promote a clean and healthy environment to live in. The rubbish we throw away everyday can creates waste. Recycling means that there is less rubbish, which makes our environment cleaner and healthier Besides recycling saves raw materials. The more we recycle the few raw materials we need. Definitely, it can help to save wild places and the animals that they live in them. Recycling papers, for example means that fewer timber forests are needed As stewards of the environment we are responsible for preserving and protecting our resources. We should take care our environment not only for ourselves but for future generations. Based on the reasons stated above. I believe that recycling is really important to be done now.

Use the graphic organizer below. Do this activity in your English notebook. Recycling, why is it important? Recycling is important to be done. It will promote a clean and healthy environment to live in. The rubbish we throw away everyday can creates waste. Recycling means that there is less rubbish, which makes our environment cleaner and healthier. Besides, recycling saves raw materials. The more we recycle, the few raw materials we need. Definitely, it can help to save wild places and the animals that they live in them. Recycling papers, for example, means that fewer timber forests are needed. As stewards of the environment, we are responsible for preserving and protecting our resources. We should take care our environment not only for ourselves but for future generations. Based on the reasons stated above, I believe that recycling is really important to be done now. Topic: High Modality Words: Language of Opinion:​</h2><br />

Mangroves and sea grass meadows in sparkling dew,
Fresh air touching one’s soul in calming view,
Such are wonderful gifts of our Mother Nature.
But population bursts with some humans selfish and cruel,
Urban and industrial development changed mother nature,
Breaking her heart with sorrow and pain,
Overharvesting marine species for more gain,
Dredging of sand done and no one seems to care.
Clean sands covered with shattered trash thrown in hastes,
Clear water turns dark with improperly disposed wastes,
Dynamite fishing makes aquatic species weep,
Excessive use of chemicals households do keep,
Air we breathe is exhausting, it isn’t fair.
Destructions of man must come to end,
For nature’s revenge is cruel and hard to mend,
Take care of the environment providing our needs,
Start now, correct the wrong ways and deeds,
Take part! Conserve and protect our mother nature.
