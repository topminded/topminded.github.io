Mental illnesses are common in the United States. More than 50 million Americans struggle with mental illness (Mental Health America: Adult Data 2022. Accessed January 25, 2023) and 1 in 5 young people (age 13-18) has or will develop a mental illness in their lifetime. (Mental Health Facts: Children and Teens." National Alliance on Mental Illness, 2017. Accessed May 7, 2019) The prevalence of common mental disorders is on the rise among the populations of western industrial nations (Twenge et al., 2010, Hidaka, 2012). A strong link has been found between mental and physical health (Nabi et al., 2008, Surtees et al., 2008). Ohrnberger, Fichera and Sutton (2017) find strong cross-effects between physical and mental health even after controlling for confounders. However, studies show that exercise can treat mild to moderate depression as effectively as antidepressant medication-but without the side-effects, of course. As one example, a recent study done by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that running for 15 minutes a day or walking for an hour reduces the risk of major depression by 26%. In addition to relieving depression symptoms, research also shows that maintaining an exercise schedule can prevent you from relapsing. Physical exercise has also been proven to have a positive effect on mental health. It can also help with concentration and focus, which are important for academic success. According to the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), physical activity has an impact on cognitive skills such as concentration and attention, and it also enhances classroom attitudes and behaviours, all of which are important components of improved academic performance. Exercising regularly can also help students stay physically healthy, which in turn helps them stay mentally healthy as well. Exercise releases endorphins that make us feel good and energized throughout the day. The American College of Cardiology recently conducted a study that revealed that children with high levels of leadership skills and empathy were “more likely to care about their own health, perhaps adopting life-long healthy behaviors that can prevent heart disease.” A study from the University of Illinois also showed that children who are physically fit are more likely to perform better in school and achieve higher grades Therefore, people who are dealing with mental health problems needs physical exercise. ​</a>

ABSTRACTThe study determines the frequency of performance activities employed by senior high mathematics teachers and its relationship to the attitude of the students towards the subject. It is a division-wide study which includes six hundred forty-four (644) grade 12 students of the three pioneering public senior high schools in Dumaguete City, as the respondents. Results showed that the respondents experienced performance activities in their Mathematics classes every class session (46.10%) followed by every other class session (37.54%) and then once a week (13.24%). It was revealed in the study that the respondents are very positive in learning Math when they can communicate with classmates and do performance activities. The respondents believed that Math concepts are important in everyday living. It was also found out that sex and age are not influencing factors in the students' attitude in Mathematics and the more frequent the teachers give performance and group activities, the more positive the attitude of the students become in learning Mathematics. Findings of the study were disseminated to encourage teachers to continuously provide hands-on and other performance tasks to develop positive attitude towards the subject. The present K to 12 grading system of the Department of Education which gives emphasis on performance tasks should be continuously utilized. Evaluation:​</a>

Underline the reasons/ evidences that support the claim A Position Paper of Drug Testing of High Schooland College Students Drug testing is a way to evaluate the type and the possibly the amount of legal andespecially for illegal drugs substances taken by a person. Drug testing can be performedfrom small samples taken of your fingernails, saliva, or more commonly, your blood, urine, or hair. Almost 10 percent of the nation’s teens report the use of illicit drugs within the lastmonth. The drug testing in high school and college students is an important and ultimatelyone of the best solution made by the government officials to reduce and stop theincreasing amount of young drug users in schools, universities, and state colleges.Schools have made the policy of random drug testing on students to serves as a warningto not get into peer pressure. Because I believe “a friend in deed, won’t make you smokethat weed.” Drug testing in school has resulted in accurate, powerful, and a positive outcomein attempting to reduce the amount of young drug users in school. The purpose of drugtesting is not to catch whose using an illegal drug, but to prevent them from using it inthe first place. Surely, there should be action taken to punish those criminals. The currentmethod to attack drugs is at the source, by imprisoning dealers and breaking the supplychain are not so succeeding. Why drug testing is so important and necessary to be implemented, because it is important to protect teenagers at the age were, they’re easily get influenced by the peers and at the time when their attitude to education greatly affectstheir entire lives.Some sacrifice of human rights is necessary to eliminate the drug problem.

C. </strong>Being courageous in standing up and being different from your friends.</p><p><strong>5.) A. </strong>Positive attitude to ward work.</p><p></p>Personal Responsibilities<p>Personal responsibility, also known as individual responsibility, is the idea that each person makes their own decisions and is in charge of their own life.

Accessed May 7, 2019) The prevalence of common mental disorders is on the rise among the populations of western industrial nations (Twenge et al., 2010, Hidaka, 2012). A strong link has been found between mental and physical health (Nabi et al., 2008, Surtees et al., 2008). Ohrnberger, Fichera and Sutton (2017) find strong cross-effects between physical and mental health even after controlling for confounders. However, studies show that exercise can treat mild to moderate depression as effectively as antidepressant medication-but without the side-effects, of course. As one example, a recent study done by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that running for 15 minutes a day or walking for an hour reduces the risk of major depression by 26%. In addition to relieving depression symptoms, research also shows that maintaining an exercise schedule can prevent you from relapsing. Physical exercise has also been proven to have a positive effect on mental health. It can also help with concentration and focus, which are important for academic success. According to the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), physical activity has an impact on cognitive skills such as concentration and attention, and it also enhances classroom attitudes and behaviours, all of which are important components of improved academic performance. Exercising regularly can also help students stay physically healthy, which in turn helps them stay mentally healthy as well. Exercise releases endorphins that make us feel good and energized throughout the day. The American College of Cardiology recently conducted a study that revealed that children with high levels of leadership skills and empathy were “more likely to care about their own health, perhaps adopting life-long healthy behaviors that can prevent heart disease.” A study from the University of Illinois also showed that children who are physically fit are more likely to perform better in school and achieve higher grades Therefore, people who are dealing with mental health problems needs physical exercise. ​</h2><br />

                            18. INDEPENDENT TASK ACT. 1 Here is an example of an abstract. Find out if it follows the guidelines in writing an abstract. Write your evaluation inside the box.                                 ABSTRACTThe study determines the frequency of performance activities employed by senior high mathematics teachers and its relationship to the attitude of the students towards the subject. It is a division-wide study which includes six hundred forty-four (644) grade 12 students of the three pioneering public senior high schools in Dumaguete City, as the respondents. Results showed that the respondents experienced performance activities in their Mathematics classes every class session (46.10%) followed by every other class session (37.54%) and then once a week (13.24%). It was revealed in the study that the respondents are very positive in learning Math when they can communicate with classmates and do performance activities. The respondents believed that Math concepts are important in everyday living. It was also found out that sex and age are not influencing factors in the students' attitude in Mathematics and the more frequent the teachers give performance and group activities, the more positive the attitude of the students become in learning Mathematics. Findings of the study were disseminated to encourage teachers to continuously provide hands-on and other performance tasks to develop positive attitude towards the subject. The present K to 12 grading system of the Department of Education which gives emphasis on performance tasks should be continuously utilized. Evaluation:​</h2><br />
