Save Rice, Save Lives The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) reports that "one fifth of the world's population more than a billion people - depend on rice cultivation for their livelihoods". About 90% of this rice is grown in Asia by poor farmers from the rural areas. The Philippine Rice Research Institute (PRRI) says that "each Filipino wastes 2 tablespoons of cooked rice every day. When not wasted, this could result in import savings, as high as P6.2 billion and could feed 2.6 million hungry Filipinos in a year". For Filipinos, every meal is incomplete without rice. It is their main source of carbohydrates. If rice is wasted, more rice should be produced, which might affect its seling price. If more rice is needed by consumers and not enough rice is produced, the country could resort into importing rice from other counties. Besides, growing rice is not that easy and cheap. Farmers have to buy fertilizers, pay for seeding, spend for irrigation, and the use of equipment. Eat your rice right - the right amount, no leftovers. Be "rice-ponsible". "Save Rice, Save Lives," the campaign says. If you do, you save lives. Wouldn't it be more than nice What kind of text-type is the selection? What is the selection about? What does it say?

Another thing that affects cholesterol over absorption is lack of fiber in our diet. Fibers are types of carbohydrates that absorb lipids but cannot be absorbed by our intestines. Due to the inability of fibers to be absorbed, the fiber with the attached fats to eat directly go to be excreted by the large intestine. This means that the cholesterol that we intake while we eat can be lessened by adding fiber rich food in our diet. While fibers can be easily found in vegetables 
and fruits, we have a challenge of maintaining this kind of high fiber more veggies and fruits diet. This is dueto the high financial cost of this kind of diet. Citizens in classes A and B can easily sustain    eating this kind of diet long term but citizens in classes  C to E cannot afford to sustain this kind of diet thus they go back to a high fat and high carb diet. The high cost of vegetables and fruits has been one of the greatest agricultural dilemmas of our country today. We have all the mountains and fields to farm these kinds of goods but due to different factors that our agricultural sectors and farmers are facing, these inflate the prices of these products. Rampant smuggling of agricultural goods murders the marketing and pricing of our own goods. The low costing of smuggled goods leave our hard-earned native vegetables and fruits behind the shadow of these invasions thus, leaving our farmers to lower the prices of their persevered work into no more than their cost of production. Also land reforms that should have been a culprit of change for our farmers were left behind. Land reforms or agrarian reforms are changing legislation, laws, rules and regulations on the ownership of lands in our country. Sadly 70 percent of farmers in the Philippines are landless according to the National Federation of Sugar Workers (NFSW). The same organization reported 69 murdered agricultural workers by their own employees. Most of them rent farming lands summing-up to the increasing prices of fertilizers and irrigation services that causes the cost of production to increase. Giant farming oligopolies own large masses of land keeping the small-farmers in check. These small-farmers having the greatest efforts of their lives receive an injustible amount of three hundred pesos of their hard work due to their unfortunate state of not having their own land. NFSW also states that This will increase the trend of farmers discouraging their sons and daughters to run away from agriculture like it was a mud-pit of intolerable amount of hardships and pain. What will happen next? A Philippine with a negligible amount of farmers coping to catch breath like a fish taken out of water?  A land blessed with volcanic land rich in minerals built for agriculture and should be secured in food production to be thrown out of the window and be like an imbecile waiting for imported agricultural goods because our farmers are dead? A healthy agricultural system will provide a sustainable supply and low cost organic and healthy food that can be afforded by a simple Filipino people which will maintain their physical well being. And farmers with their own farmland can lower their production cost because they will not be paying rent. Lower the production cost, the lower will be the selling price.</a>

Save Rice, Save Lives The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) reports that "one fifth of the world's population more than a billion people - depend on rice cultivation for their livelihoods". About 90% of this rice is grown in Asia by poor farmers from the rural areas. The Philippine Rice Research Institute (PRRI) says that "each Filipino wastes 2 tablespoons of cooked rice every day. When not wasted, this could result in import savings, as high as P6.2 billion and could feed 2.6 million hungry Filipinos in a year". For Filipinos, every meal is incomplete without rice. It is their main source of carbohydrates. If rice is wasted, more rice should be produced, which might affect its seling price. If more rice is needed by consumers and not enough rice is produced, the country could resort into importing rice from other counties. Besides, growing rice is not that easy and cheap. Farmers have to buy fertilizers, pay for seeding, spend for irrigation, and the use of equipment. Eat your rice right - the right amount, no leftovers. Be "rice-ponsible".

                            18. who to make it shorter
Another thing that affects cholesterol over absorption is lack of fiber in our diet. Fibers are types of carbohydrates that absorb lipids but cannot be absorbed by our intestines. Due to the inability of fibers to be absorbed, the fiber with the attached fats to eat directly go to be excreted by the large intestine. This means that the cholesterol that we intake while we eat can be lessened by adding fiber rich food in our diet. While fibers can be easily found in vegetables 
and fruits, we have a challenge of maintaining this kind of high fiber more veggies and fruits diet. This is dueto the high financial cost of this kind of diet. Citizens in classes A and B can easily sustain    eating this kind of diet long term but citizens in classes  C to E cannot afford to sustain this kind of diet thus they go back to a high fat and high carb diet. The high cost of vegetables and fruits has been one of the greatest agricultural dilemmas of our country today. We have all the mountains and fields to farm these kinds of goods but due to different factors that our agricultural sectors and farmers are facing, these inflate the prices of these products. Rampant smuggling of agricultural goods murders the marketing and pricing of our own goods. The low costing of smuggled goods leave our hard-earned native vegetables and fruits behind the shadow of these invasions thus, leaving our farmers to lower the prices of their persevered work into no more than their cost of production. Also land reforms that should have been a culprit of change for our farmers were left behind. Land reforms or agrarian reforms are changing legislation, laws, rules and regulations on the ownership of lands in our country. Sadly 70 percent of farmers in the Philippines are landless according to the National Federation of Sugar Workers (NFSW). The same organization reported 69 murdered agricultural workers by their own employees. Most of them rent farming lands summing-up to the increasing prices of fertilizers and irrigation services that causes the cost of production to increase. Giant farming oligopolies own large masses of land keeping the small-farmers in check. These small-farmers having the greatest efforts of their lives receive an injustible amount of three hundred pesos of their hard work due to their unfortunate state of not having their own land. NFSW also states that This will increase the trend of farmers discouraging their sons and daughters to run away from agriculture like it was a mud-pit of intolerable amount of hardships and pain. What will happen next? A Philippine with a negligible amount of farmers coping to catch breath like a fish taken out of water?  A land blessed with volcanic land rich in minerals built for agriculture and should be secured in food production to be thrown out of the window and be like an imbecile waiting for imported agricultural goods because our farmers are dead? A healthy agricultural system will provide a sustainable supply and low cost organic and healthy food that can be afforded by a simple Filipino people which will maintain their physical well being. And farmers with their own farmland can lower their production cost because they will not be paying rent. Lower the production cost, the lower will be the selling price.</h2><br />
