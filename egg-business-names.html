                                            Men have preserved their foods from ancient times in order to keep the results of harvesting for winter months, for resale, for storage, and for transporting from sea to island, overseas, or cross-country. To do so, they generally used nature's methods, which are drying, parching and fermenting, Parching is the most natural method, but for many thousands of years. others have also been used. Direct fermentation of liquids, usually by the introduction of yeast, has not only preserved liquids but also enhanced their quality, the same of course applying to salting Smoking has preserved, and sometimes improved both fish and meat. Hickory wood is generally used for the fires, and natural juices are contained by a slight coating of wood creosote It was not until recently that the causes of rolienness were understood, these being the reactions of bacteria, inolds, yeasts and micro-organisms. Some fermentation and mooks arc, of course, necessary in the production of food and drink; molds, for example, being used in cheese-making but the real breakthrough in preservation against the causes of rottenness came, when it was learnt how to deal with the micro-organisms present in all foods and drinks, and which meat chemically over a period to produce unpalatable or poisonous food or drink. There are three basic methods. Firstly, food may be preserved by cooling or freezing, to a very low temperature when long-term preservation is required. This was originally done by packing in a mixture of salt and ice, today. cold storage is big business and refrigeration is a highly-developed science. Dehydration may be bracketed with this method, as the principle involved is the same, namely to suspend the operation of bacteria which requires normal temperatures for chemical reaction. This is why reconstituted eggs cannot against dehydrated, and melted ice-cream refrozen, the second method of destruction is by heat-processes, which destroy all the bacteria present in food and drink. This process is used before canning foods in hermetically-sealed containers, great care being taken not to allow the foods or drink s to become re-infested after cooling and before canning, the third method is to preserve by the addition of chemicals, which control or destroy bacteria. this is merely a follow-up of the old systems of salting, smoking and candling. Eventually, the method of 'cold sterilization' is expected to supersede most of the others; this amounts to exposing the food-stuffs to lionizing radiation.​</a>

                            5. Men have preserved their foods from ancient times in order to keep the results of harvesting for winter months, for resale, for storage, and for transporting from sea to island, overseas, or cross-country. To do so, they generally used nature's methods, which are drying, parching and fermenting, Parching is the most natural method, but for many thousands of years. others have also been used. Direct fermentation of liquids, usually by the introduction of yeast, has not only preserved liquids but also enhanced their quality, the same of course applying to salting Smoking has preserved, and sometimes improved both fish and meat. Hickory wood is generally used for the fires, and natural juices are contained by a slight coating of wood creosote It was not until recently that the causes of rolienness were understood, these being the reactions of bacteria, inolds, yeasts and micro-organisms. Some fermentation and mooks arc, of course, necessary in the production of food and drink; molds, for example, being used in cheese-making but the real breakthrough in preservation against the causes of rottenness came, when it was learnt how to deal with the micro-organisms present in all foods and drinks, and which meat chemically over a period to produce unpalatable or poisonous food or drink. There are three basic methods. Firstly, food may be preserved by cooling or freezing, to a very low temperature when long-term preservation is required. This was originally done by packing in a mixture of salt and ice, today. cold storage is big business and refrigeration is a highly-developed science. Dehydration may be bracketed with this method, as the principle involved is the same, namely to suspend the operation of bacteria which requires normal temperatures for chemical reaction. This is why reconstituted eggs cannot against dehydrated, and melted ice-cream refrozen, the second method of destruction is by heat-processes, which destroy all the bacteria present in food and drink. This process is used before canning foods in hermetically-sealed containers, great care being taken not to allow the foods or drink s to become re-infested after cooling and before canning, the third method is to preserve by the addition of chemicals, which control or destroy bacteria. this is merely a follow-up of the old systems of salting, smoking and candling. Eventually, the method of 'cold sterilization' is expected to supersede most of the others; this amounts to exposing the food-stuffs to lionizing radiation.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1.</strong> The essay is about the various methods used by humans to preserve food throughout history and how these methods have evolved over time.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> The main topic of the essay is food preservation.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> The essay provides various facts related to food preservation methods, such as drying, parching, fermenting, direct fermentation, salting, smoking, and the use of chemicals to control or destroy bacteria. It also discusses the importance of understanding microorganisms in food preservation, the three basic methods of food preservation (cooling/freezing, heat processes, and chemical preservation), and the potential future of cold sterilization.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> The author uses a descriptive and informative structure in the essay, presenting various methods and historical background related to food preservation.</p><p><strong>5. </strong>The informative essay on food preservation provides readers with knowledge and understanding of the methods used by humans to preserve food throughout history, and how these methods have evolved over time. This knowledge can be applied in everyday life, such as in understanding the various methods of food preservation used by food manufacturers, and in making informed decisions about the food we eat and how we store it.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
