                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Just for a minute I want you to imagine a world without discrimination. Everyone is treated the same. Not treated the same with jobs and money but treated fairly by others, treated fairly by your peers. In a world with no discrimination there would be no problems, obviously but everyone would be so much happier and the world would be a better place. I realize this will not happen but even small issues of discrimination like not being friends with someone because of their social or economic status can have big effects on people and solving the small problems could lead to big change in the problem of discrimination. I believe that all people are equal and should be treated equally by all people.</p><p></p><p>One reason why I believe there should not be any discrimination is because there is no reason to discriminate. Many people I am sure would disagree with this but if you really get to thinking about discrimination, there is absolutely no reason to. All people are different and have their own flaws and these differences should be embraced and not rejected and discriminated against.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest po ty</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Our world has always been parted into two groups: victims of discrimination and those who discriminate against the former. The definition of discrimination denies opportunity or equal rights to a specific group of people that may be differentiated based on their religion, skin colour, or gender.</strong></p><p></p>                   All about discrimination<p>                                    In our society today, we always judge people about their culture, the country they live in, about their skin color, and also other subjects of their living. Why would we sometimes do that to others? And what will happen to the people that we discriminate? And also, What is Discrimination?</p><p></p><p>                                   Discrimination (Pagtatanggi) is an act of making unjustified distinctions between people based on their subjects, most of them are about their skin color and also their country. In modern times, white people are considered kings and queens, while the brown and black are slaves, if you are american, you are perfect, if you come from a poor country you are bad or a criminal and Etc. We discriminate people because research shows that the attitudes of people who discriminate are a reflection of a complex set of factors including their history, sociocultural practices, economic forces, sociological trends and the influence of community and family beliefs. </p><p></p><p>                                      There are types of discrimination that is usually used until today, and these are just a quarter of many more types.</p><p>Firstly, we have Color discrimination. Just like the example from above, this is the most common type of discrimination, that sometimes lead to murders. Remember the case of George Floyd? That is an example of color discrimination. </p><p>Secondly, we have disability discrimination. If you have a disability, you will be judged quickly. I remembered about someone being judged because he was colorblind and the mother took her son away from him because "Colorblindness is contagious". </p><p>And our third and last one is religious Discrimination. It is so common, especially Christian people judging the Muslims because of their religion and it's tradition. They got so used to it today so they won't be minding them.</p><p></p><p>                                   If someone is discriminated, they either get hurt, or just got used to it. Over the last decade, suicide rates in the United States have increased dramatically among racial and ethnic minorities, and Black Americans in particular. For Black young adults ages 15–24 years, suicide is the third leading cause of death with approximately 3,000 Black Americans dying by suicide each year. And we can stop it from happening by stopping discrimination. </p><p></p><p>                                     In conclusion, there has and still is discrimination in America.  We can stop  discrimination by not using stereotypes. And by not judging people by how they look. Just because someone is different, doesn't mean they should be treated differently. You may not agree with someone else's decisions doesn't mean that their decision is wrong.  There are many different lifestyles and different values.  Some else's values may conflict your own, all people have a right to live the way they want to in America. All Americans have a right to their own happiness.  It's their life, not yours.</p><p></p><p>(An essay from a random dude who just wants to oof their life because of stress, HAHA) </p><br />

                            9. essay about discrimination against lgbt?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>everyone. But in the Philippines, students who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) too often find that their schooling experience is marred by bullying, discrimination, lack of access to LGBT-related information, and in some cases, physical or sexual assault. These abuses can cause deep and lasting harm and curtail students’ right to education, protected under Philippine and international law.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, lawmakers and school administrators in the Philippines have recognized that bullying of LGBT youth is a serious problem, and designed interventions to address it. In 2012, the Department of Education (DepEd), which oversees primary and secondary schools, enacted a Child Protection Policy designed to address bullying and discrimination in schools, including on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. The following year, Congress passed the Anti-Bullying Law of 2013, with implementing rules and regulations that enumerate sexual orientation and gender identity as prohibited grounds for bullying and harassment. The adoption of these policies sends a strong signal that bullying and discrimination are unacceptable and should not be tolerated in educational institutions.</p><p></p><p></p>Paraphrase mo nalang <br /><br />Over the past decade, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people have made significant legal and political gains in the United States, including the freedom to marry. Despite this progress, federal law does not expressly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in fields like employment, housing, and access to services, and fewer than half of the states offer explicit protections for LGBT people at the state level. Without these protections, LGBT people across the United States lack clear recourse and redress when they are fired, evicted, or refused service because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.<br /><br />Against this backdrop of legal vulnerability, lawmakers who oppose marriage for same-sex couples and recent moves to advance transgender equality have led an anti-LGBT charge, pushing for, and often succeeding in getting, new laws that carve out religious exemptions for individuals who claim that compliance with particular laws interferes with their religious or moral beliefs. While LGBT equality is not the only area where exemptions have been debated—particularly as lawmakers have sought to substantially broaden exemptions related to sexual and reproductive healthcare—this report specifically examines a worrying wave of exemptions being introduced to blunt the recognition of LGBT rights across the United States.<br /><br />The freedom of religion, as well as nondiscrimination, is a significant rights issue, and it is important that governments do not unnecessarily burden the exercise of religious conscience. This is especially important to minority religious groups, whose practices are all too easily trampled on by laws and policies enacted by majorities. But when exemptions to laws to accommodate religious beliefs or practices impinge on the rights of others or core societal values like nondiscrimination, lawmakers should proceed with caution.<br /><br />Proponents of these laws argue that they properly balance religious freedom with the rights of LGBT individuals. In fact, with few exceptions, the laws as drafted create blanket exemptions for religious believers to discriminate with no consideration of or even mechanism for consideration of the harms and burdens on others. Because of their narrow focus on the objector, the laws provide little protection for the rights, well-being, or dignity of those who are turned away.<br /><br />Statements made by legislative supporters of the laws, and in some cases the content of the laws themselves, moreover, make clear that they aim to push back against recent gains toward LGBT equality and to dilute the rights of LGBT people to secure protection from invidious discrimination.<br /><br />Together, the failure of most states to enact nondiscrimination protections and the growing number of religious exemption laws leave many LGBT people with little recourse when they encounter discrimination. While these exemptions are almost always couched in the language of religious freedom or religious liberty, they directly and indirectly harm LGBT people in a variety of ways.<br /><br />The results of this research indicate that the laws already enacted in eight states and the bills still under consideration in many more do not strike a proper balance between the freedom of religion and the equal rights of LGBT people under the law. And in fact, few if any of these laws even represent a serious attempt to do that.

                        <p></p><p>Discrimination has played a role in humanity from the beginnings of human existence to the modern societies of today.  Every individual has experienced an act of discrimination at some point; yet, most questions surrounding this fundamental human flaw remain unanswered.  One belief that has overwhelming support is the fact that discrimination can lead to significant negative effects.  These effects mediate how an individual is able or unable to deal with discrimination.  Thus, the discussion of discrimination is important because many individuals either engage in or face discrimination, whether they realize it or not.  However, this behavior often results in damaging consequences for all involved that can significantly affect an individual’s entire life.</p><p>Discrimination arises from an individual’s belief in a stereotype.  Stereotypes are most accurately defined as “an association between group(s) and the characteristic(s) attributed to those group(s)” (Kurylo 337).  Though experts disagree on the exact definition, they do agree that stereotypes are controversial and often contain an element of inaccuracy or bias.  This causes groups targeted by stereotypes, or even those who hold stereotypes, to experience negative consequences, regardless of the stereotype’s intentions (338).  As a result, people are encouraged to avoid the use of stereotypes in order to prevent unnecessary discriminatory practices (339).  To avoid the use of stereotypes, however, people must first fully</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Gender Wage Gap And Wage Discrimination: Illusion or Reality?</p><p>Howard J. Wall</p><p>After more than a generation since the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 together barred employment and wage discrimination, the gap between men's and women's average earnings is still wide. In 1999, women's median weekly earnings for full-time workers were 76.5 percent of men's—a gender wage gap of 23.5 cents for every dollar earned by the median man.</p><p></p><p>Many believe that the wage gap is a good measure of the extent of gender wage discrimination, which occurs when men and women are not paid equal wages for substantially equal work. Irasema Garza, director of the Women's Bureau of the U.S. Department of Labor, recently testified to the widespread nature of this view in policy-making circles. Before Congress last June, she outlined steps being taken by the current Administration to eliminate the gender wage gap. Ironically, the gap has increased since 1993, when the Administration took office. After falling steadily between 1979 and 1993, it rose in four of the six years from 1993 to 1999, ending the period a little more than one-half of a cent higher.</p><p></p><p>This uncomfortable trend, however, has little to do with a failure to fight wage discrimination. The weight of evidence suggests that little of the wage gap is related to wage discrimination at all. Instead, wage discrimination accounts for, at most, about one-fourth of the gap, with the remainder due to differences between men and women in important determinants of earnings such as the number of hours worked, experience, training and occupation. Moreover, even this one-fourth of the gap may have less to do with wage discrimination than with the accumulated effects of shorter hours and interrupted careers on women's earnings and promotion prospects. To see this, let's break the wage gap numbers down in greater detail.</p><br />

                        <p>Gender discrimination is the unfair treatment of individuals on the basis of their gender, rather than their skills or qualifications. It affects both men and women and can take a number of forms including unequal pay and access to healthcare and educational opportunities, unfair treatment in the workplace, or exclusion from certain professions. Unfair gender discrimination may also manifest as sexual harassment or abuse. </p><p></p><p>Gender discrimination can be difficult to identify and address because it is often deeply ingrained in a culture or accepted as "the norm." To combat gender discrimination, laws regulating workplace equality have been implemented in many countries. Additionally, businesses and organizations may implement policies that reduce gender bias and ensure fair and equitable treatment of all genders. Educational initiatives may also be taken to raise awareness of gender discrimination and its effects on society.  In some cases, legal action may be necessary to ensure fair and equal treatment for all individuals, regardless of gender.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Gender discrimination is a pervasive issue that has been present in society for centuries. It is a form of inequality that affects individuals based on their gender, which can be male or female. This discrimination takes various forms, including unequal treatment, stereotypes, prejudice, and biases. Gender discrimination affects individuals in all aspects of their lives, including education, employment, healthcare, and social interactions.</p><p></p><p>One of the most significant areas where gender discrimination is prevalent is in the workplace. Women have been historically paid less than men for the same job and have had fewer opportunities for advancement. Despite the progress made in recent years, women still face a glass ceiling in many industries, where they are unable to advance to top-level positions due to their gender. Additionally, women are often subjected to harassment and hostile work environments that create a hostile and unsafe work environment.</p><p></p><p>Gender discrimination is also evident in the educational sector, where women are often subjected to negative stereotypes and biases that limit their educational opportunities. Girls may be discouraged from pursuing certain subjects or activities due to gender biases, leading to a lack of diversity in academic fields and a lack of representation in leadership positions. This not only affects the opportunities available to girls but also has wider implications for the workforce and society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>Healthcare is another area where gender discrimination is evident. Women's health concerns are often disregarded or dismissed, leading to inadequate medical treatment and care. Furthermore, women often face discrimination in accessing healthcare, including reproductive healthcare services, due to societal and cultural biases.</p><p></p><p>The effects of gender discrimination are far-reaching and can have long-term consequences. Discrimination can lead to a lack of self-esteem and confidence, limited opportunities, and diminished economic prospects. It can also lead to mental health issues, including depression and anxiety.</p><p></p><p>To combat gender discrimination, it is essential to raise awareness and educate people on the impacts of gender discrimination. Governments and organizations must implement policies and initiatives that promote gender equality, such as equal pay, parental leave, and flexible working arrangements. Furthermore, individuals must challenge gender stereotypes and biases and create a culture that values diversity and inclusivity.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, gender discrimination is a pervasive issue that affects individuals in all aspects of their lives. It is essential to address this issue and work towards a society that values diversity and equality, regardless of gender. By working together, we can create a world where everyone is treated fairly and given equal opportunities to thrive.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Discrimination in the workplace occurs when an employee experiences harsh or unfair treatment due to their race, religion, national origin, disabled or veteran status, or other legally protected characteristics.   Discrimination is one of the biggest problems people face in the workplace and it must be dealt with forcefully.                                              </p><p></p><p>There are different ways of discrimination that occur very often in the workplace.

Another reason is that older employees may be paid more than new hires, so companies replace older workers with new workers just for that reason. This type of change is in addition to those who are simply biased against older workers and who take any opportunity to remove older works and bring in new blood</p><p></p><p>Age discrimination is mainly toward the older (60 +) and younger (14-17) people in their early teens. Many Americans have been fired, forced into retirement, or turned down from a job due to their age. Older age employers are discriminated against in the workplace because of appearance and their ability to do the work required is believed to slow. Employers are more likely to hire a person who is much younger and more attractive than an elderly person. Also, employers want to employ people who are able to do the work required. This is another way in which older people are discriminated against even though they may be very capable to do the job.  “The Age Discrimination Act of 1975 prohibits discrimination on the basis of age in programs and activities</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Racial Discrimination</strong></p><p></p><p>“The Urgency of Intersectionality” is written and was spoken by Kimberlé Crenshaw onTEDTalks on December 7, 2016. Kimberelé Crenshaw was born on May 5, 1959, and is anAmerican civil rights advocate and a leading scholar of critical race theory. She is also aprofessor at the UCLA School of Law and Columbia Law School where she specializes ingender and race issues. In the video, Kimberlé Crenshaw is talking about how the discriminationhas become more and deeper than just the race of an individual. Which results in going furtherinto the sex of the person. Throughout the video, Kimberlé Crenshaw argues how the public hasno “frame” or point of view and women of color are disregarded in discussions of racial andgender discrimination, and this has resulted in invisible prejudice.According to Kimberlé Crenshaw, intersectionality is how race, gender, class, and otherindividual or physical characteristics intersect with each other and create overlapping. KimberléCrenshaw says, “Many years ago, I began to use the term “intersectionality” to deal with the factthat many of our social justice problems like racism and sexism are often overlapping, creatingmultiple levels of social injustice” (00:4:54-00:5:08). Intersectionality creates interdependentsystems of discrimination and disadvantages. Kimberlé Crenshaw created this theory to explainthe oppression of African-American women. To explain this theory further, Kimberlé Crenshawgives an example of her own encounter with a woman named Emma Degraffenreid who was anAfrican-American woman, a working wife, and a mother. Kimberlé Crenshaw read aboutEmma’s story from the pages of legal opinion which was written by a judge who dismissed</p><br />

                        <p></p><p>Body shaming, defined as an inappropriate negative statement and attitudes towards another person weight or size.  It can also reach into discrimination against individuals who may be overweight.  There are negative attitudes and stereotypes in the media and elsewhere towards plus size people.  A backlash against body shaming has resulted in the coming of the term itself in attempts to bring a more positive attitude toward diverse body size and styles (Bodyshaming.org 2012).  There are many people out there working towards putting an end to body shaming as well as the stereotype that goes along with being plus size.  Body shaming is wrong and needs to stop.</p><p>Have you ever heard, or said to yourself, I’m too fat I’m chunky I’m obese I wish I was thinner if only I were smaller, then you have practiced what is known as body shaming, and you’re not alone.  Many things influence this negative image that some have of their body. Body image and self-esteem go hand in hand.  Body image includes how we perceive our bodies visually how we feel about our physical appearance how we think and talk to ourselves about our bodies our sense of how other people view our bodies our sense of our bodies in physical space and our level of connectedness to our bodies. Feeling ashamed about your body is what many people seen as overweight struggle with.  Poor body image increases the risks for extreme weight control behaviors such as extreme dieting exercise compulsion laxative abuse vomiting smoking and the use of non-FDA approved dieting pills. Many people are embracing their body no matter what the scale says.  They are going to extremes to show the positive side of being plus size. Extensive levels of body-shaming can have negative emotional effects, including a reduction in self-esteem and other issues such as eating disorders, anxiety, body dysmorphia and depression. Also, body shaming can lead to serious depression, especially when people feel their body can not meet social criteria.</p><br />
