In the General Assembly drawings, all parts are drawn in their working position. This includes orthographic drawings of assembled products, parts lists, and related data needed in manufacturing process.2. An Assembly drawing conveys the completed shape of the product, overall dimensions, relative position of each part and the functional relationship among various components. 3. Working drawings are composed according to industry standards so that all the information is easily and clearly understood, and standard conventions and units are used. 4. There are two distinctive types of working drawings; the Detail and Assembly drawings. 5. A Detail Assembly drawing shows how all components are assembled and provides all the necessary details, dimensions and joining techniques to fully assemble all or part of the project. 6. Exploded, General, Layout, Detail Assembly drawings are examples of a Detail Working drawings 7. In the Layout Assembly drawing, the parts are separately displayed, but they are aligned according to their assembly positions and sequences. 8. The Exploded assembly drawing shows rough preliminary design ideas sometimes in a sketch form. 9. A Detail Assembly drawing has several detailed drawings within it. 10. Working drawings are drawings used as a reference or guide in the manufacture of a product. 11. Half Section is obtained when the cutting-plane extends entirely through the object in a straight line and the front half of the object is totally. 12. Full Section refers to one quart of the object to be cut or removed. 13. In constructing Assembly Drawings, if there are intemal assemblies, sectional views should be used. 14. Sectional view is a method of drawing presentation showing the interior part part of the building especially when the inner parts are complicated. 15. Dimensions in detailed drawing should be shown clearly.​​</a>

This starts with admission of students to the university. When a regular student, i.e. a student who comes from a Dutch high-school, sends in his admission form such a student is registered by the admissions office. Subsequently, the eligibility to study in a certain program is checked based on the information that the student provided on his admission form. For students who arrive from another school, such as a polytechnic, the previous study that the student took, according to his admission form, must be examined in detail. Polytechnic students can either come to the university after completing one year of courses (propedeuse) or after receiving a polytechnic diploma. Students from universities in other countries are also accepted. Also for them, the studies that they took previously must be examined in detail. When students are considered eligible and the courses that they have already followed (if applicable) check out, they are enrolled at the university, which involves sending a letter that they are accepted and entering the details of their enrollment in the information system of the university. The students then become a student of their respective study: industrial engineering, building or construction engineering. After the students are enrolled, they can take courses or do projects and they can use the services that are provided by the university, which include: language training and sports facilities. Projects are done on an individual basis by a student together with a lecturer. The university recognizes part-time students who do their studies while they are working in a company. These students typically do projects of a more practical nature than the other students, such that the process that is followed during the project are also different for these students. Design a process architecture as follows: 1. identify the case types that should appear in the process architecture 2. identify the functions that should appear in the process architecture 3. draw a case/function matrix 4. identify the processes in the case function matrix, split up processes if and only if one of the guidelines applies, clearly indicate which guideline you applied where​</a>

The search results are generally presented in a line of results, often referred to as search engine results pages (SERPs) The information may be a mix of links to web pages, images, videos, infographics, articles, research papers, and other types of files. Some search engines also mine data available in databases or open directories. Unlike web directories, which are maintained only by human editors, search engines also maintain real-time information by running an algorithm on a web crawler.

TRUE or FALSE Instruction: Write the whole word TRUE if you agree with the statement while FALSE if not. Write your answer on the blank space provided. (Please use this paper as your answer sheet) 1. In the General Assembly drawings, all parts are drawn in their working position. This includes orthographic drawings of assembled products, parts lists, and related data needed in manufacturing process.2. An Assembly drawing conveys the completed shape of the product, overall dimensions, relative position of each part and the functional relationship among various components. 3. Working drawings are composed according to industry standards so that all the information is easily and clearly understood, and standard conventions and units are used. 4. There are two distinctive types of working drawings; the Detail and Assembly drawings. 5. A Detail Assembly drawing shows how all components are assembled and provides all the necessary details, dimensions and joining techniques to fully assemble all or part of the project. 6. Exploded, General, Layout, Detail Assembly drawings are examples of a Detail Working drawings 7. In the Layout Assembly drawing, the parts are separately displayed, but they are aligned according to their assembly positions and sequences. 8. The Exploded assembly drawing shows rough preliminary design ideas sometimes in a sketch form. 9. A Detail Assembly drawing has several detailed drawings within it. 10. Working drawings are drawings used as a reference or guide in the manufacture of a product. 11. Half Section is obtained when the cutting-plane extends entirely through the object in a straight line and the front half of the object is totally. 12. Full Section refers to one quart of the object to be cut or removed. 13. In constructing Assembly Drawings, if there are intemal assemblies, sectional views should be used. 14. Sectional view is a method of drawing presentation showing the interior part part of the building especially when the inner parts are complicated. 15.

This starts with admission of students to the university. When a regular student, i.e. a student who comes from a Dutch high-school, sends in his admission form such a student is registered by the admissions office. Subsequently, the eligibility to study in a certain program is checked based on the information that the student provided on his admission form. For students who arrive from another school, such as a polytechnic, the previous study that the student took, according to his admission form, must be examined in detail. Polytechnic students can either come to the university after completing one year of courses (propedeuse) or after receiving a polytechnic diploma. Students from universities in other countries are also accepted. Also for them, the studies that they took previously must be examined in detail. When students are considered eligible and the courses that they have already followed (if applicable) check out, they are enrolled at the university, which involves sending a letter that they are accepted and entering the details of their enrollment in the information system of the university. The students then become a student of their respective study: industrial engineering, building or construction engineering. After the students are enrolled, they can take courses or do projects and they can use the services that are provided by the university, which include: language training and sports facilities. Projects are done on an individual basis by a student together with a lecturer. The university recognizes part-time students who do their studies while they are working in a company. These students typically do projects of a more practical nature than the other students, such that the process that is followed during the project are also different for these students. Design a process architecture as follows: 1. identify the case types that should appear in the process architecture 2. identify the functions that should appear in the process architecture 3. draw a case/function matrix 4. identify the processes in the case function matrix, split up processes if and only if one of the guidelines applies, clearly indicate which guideline you applied where​</h2><br />
