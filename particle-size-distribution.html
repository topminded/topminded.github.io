Current travels long distances and the resistance offered by long power lines is large. When current pass through them power is lost due to the heating effect of the current 2. High voltage power lines are used in power transmission 3. It is recommended to use tamper proof and accurate meter reading 4. The umbrella shape of the insulating diso prevents water from forming a conductive path along the stack during rainy days. 5. Maintain the network components and replace those that are deteriorating, worn out or faulty. 6. External environmental conditions pollutants, dust particles and industrial chemicals from factories contaminate the body of conductors 7. Haphazard installation of distribution systems to cope with demands to new areas 8. Proper selection of conductor size, as well as the transformer in terms of efficiency, size and location. In particular, it is important to locate the distribution transformers at the load center and if possible keep the number to a minimum 9. Load imbalance among the phases 10. Improving power factor by adding shunt capacitors.​</a>

The dispersed particles in a suspension are larger than those in solutions and in collade The partides in suspension are larger than 100 nanometers. The large particle size in a suspension causes the phases of a suspension to separate upon standing Hence, the solid particles of the milk of magnesia settled to the bottom after some time. Some examples of suspension include oil mixed in water, muddy watercream and milk To sum it up. solution appears to be transparent The light passes through with no scattering from solute particles which are molecule in size. It is homogeneous and does not settle out nor cannot be filtered but can be separated using the process of distillation A suspension like the mixture of sand and water is cloudy and heterogeneous. Its particles are larger than 10,000 Angstroms which allows them to be filtered. Allowing the suspension to stand makes the particles to separate out from its components A colloid is intermediate between a solu- tion and a suspension. While a suspension will separate out, a colloid will not. Colloids can be distinguished from solutions using the Tyndall effect. Light passing through a colloi- dal dispersion, such as smoky or foggy air, will be reflected by the larger particles and the light beam will be visible.

                                            C. EXPLORE Your Targets: 1. Differentiate amorphous from crystalline solids 2. Identify the distinguishing features of amorphous and crystalline solids. Materials: • Large kitchen bowl • Two sizes of round candies* • If 2 sizes of ro candies are not available you can use any round object with the appropriate size. *Candies should be different in size, but larger candy should be no more than 3 times larger than the small candy. Both types of candy should be perfectly round. Procedure: 1. Pour enough of the smaller candy into the bowl to cover the bottom with one layer of candy. Each candy represents one atom. Gently shake the bowl from side to side and watch how the "atoms" move. Keep shaking until all of the atoms line up in straight lines, as seen in the picture to the right Gulde Questions: a. What do you notice on your model? b. What type of solid was shown by your model? c. How many directions of ordering can you find? d. What happens at the edges? e. How will you describe the orientation of the particles? Write down your observations. 2. Take the bowl with the small atoms and add the bigger atoms (the larger size candy). You do not need as many of the bigger atoms, estimate one fourth to one third of the small atoms. Mix the atoms with your hands until all the big atoms have been distributed. Again, gently shake the mixture and watch what happens to the atoms. The model should start to look something like the picture on the right Guide Questions: a. What do you notice on your model? b. What type of solid was shown by your model? c. How many directions of ordering can you find? d. What happens at the edges? e. How will you describe the orientation of the particles?

The dispersed particles in a suspension are larger than those in solutions and in collade The partides in suspension are larger than 100 nanometers. The large particle size in a suspension causes the phases of a suspension to separate upon standing Hence, the solid particles of the milk of magnesia settled to the bottom after some time.

                            26. C. EXPLORE Your Targets: 1. Differentiate amorphous from crystalline solids 2. Identify the distinguishing features of amorphous and crystalline solids. Materials: • Large kitchen bowl • Two sizes of round candies* • If 2 sizes of ro candies are not available you can use any round object with the appropriate size. *Candies should be different in size, but larger candy should be no more than 3 times larger than the small candy. Both types of candy should be perfectly round. Procedure: 1. Pour enough of the smaller candy into the bowl to cover the bottom with one layer of candy. Each candy represents one atom. Gently shake the bowl from side to side and watch how the "atoms" move. Keep shaking until all of the atoms line up in straight lines, as seen in the picture to the right Gulde Questions: a. What do you notice on your model? b. What type of solid was shown by your model? c. How many directions of ordering can you find? d. What happens at the edges? e. How will you describe the orientation of the particles? Write down your observations. 2. Take the bowl with the small atoms and add the bigger atoms (the larger size candy). You do not need as many of the bigger atoms, estimate one fourth to one third of the small atoms. Mix the atoms with your hands until all the big atoms have been distributed. Again, gently shake the mixture and watch what happens to the atoms. The model should start to look something like the picture on the right Guide Questions: a. What do you notice on your model? b.
