By Mr. Bun D. Tenorio Jr.
Lifted from the book The Phoenix World of Reading
I have a story to tell. This is about a young boy I know. He was born poor to parents who were farmers. When he grew up, however, he was able to meet and mingle with kings and queens, presidents, and senators. No magic took place there. This is a real story. Because the kid was poor, he didn’t have a single toy. He would go to his neighbor’s house to use the toys of his playmates. In school, he barely had notebooks. Even if his mother couldn’t afford to buy him notebooks, this kid persevered to study. This boy was poor but rich in fighting spirit. Often he would go to school without allowance, wearing slippers and a tattered uniform. For breakfast, he would fill his glass of coffee with rice. For lunch, he would mash banana and steamed rice. For dinner, he and his brothers would share one fried egg, divided equally among them. One day, he came home with the sole of his foot bleeding. He stepped on a piece of broken glass and it pierced through his worn out slippers. “Nay, please buy me a pair of slippers,” the boy asked his mother. “Son, we don’t have any money. Just be careful the next time.”In time, all his wounds were healed. They left scars all over his body. He graduated from grade school with honors. He continued to study.
He could not have studied in high school were if not for the elementary teachers who helped him get a scholarship. This kid was full of ambition, only he had no resources. So he could go to college, his mother offered a novena to God for him to pass the entrance examination of the University of the Philippines. God heard her prayers and this boy got a scholarship. He was given a monthly stipend and a book allowance, which he gave to his mother, so they could have money. Slowly but surely, his dreams were gradually being realized. The kid who imagined that he lived in a sandcastle became a writer. He met, mingled with, and wrote stories of people, the movers and shakers of the world that he thought only existed in the sandcastle of his dreamland.
It may sound proud to listen to the story of the kid but this is the truth. He achieved this little success in life because he once dreamed that he would be able to buy pairs and pairs of slippers and shoes, that the wounds of the past would be healed, that there would be food on their table. To this day, this boy continues to dream.
I am this kid.

                                            "I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines—Baler. My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education. During those Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, did my family live for years. When I was at the age of five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his own feet as a means of transportation. My classes started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up very early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law."Read the statements below.

George and Mirriam were already married for 17 years. Their eldest is 10 yrs old named Nathan and their youngest is 7 years old named Hannah. They are living in Palawan together with their witty dog, Bantay. While the couple are working, George’s father, Lolo Berting is the one who fetches the two kids at school, while Lola Pasing does the household chores and the cooking. Since Nathan was born, both Lolo Berting and Lola Pasing lived together with George’s family to assist the couple in parenting Hannah and Nathan. Lita was 12 yrs old when she knew that she was adopted. Mr. Benjamin and Mrs. Linda had three kids and all of them were boys. Since the couple wanted to have a baby girl, they decided to adopt, because they were too old to have another baby. It was Lina’s birthday when the couple talked to her and told her the truth. Lina wholeheartedly accepted the truth and embraced Mr. and Mrs. Santos. Lina’s biological parents died on a car accident, that’s why the couple adopted Lina. Major Mark Delos Reyes of the Philippines Army was assigned in the province of Tuguegarao. In the call of duty and service, Maj. Delos Reyes and his wife decided that the whole family will transfer to Tuguegarao where Maj. Delos Reyes was assigned. The next day, they packed all their things and left their home. Joyce is fifth among the 13 children of Mr. and Mrs. Aquino. She was 16 yrs. old and will be a grade 11 student next year. Because of poverty, her parents cannot support her studies anymore. Her father is a farmer and he is the only one who provides for their living. Her aunt was living in Manila and offered her father to support Joyce’s study until she finishes her college. A condition was given to them, though. Joyce will have to stay in Manila and will live with her aunt Tessie and her family​</a>

                                            Who is the 17th President before his political career?Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos is the lone child of former First Lady Imelda Marcos and late President Ferdinand Marcos, Sr. Before he entered politics, Bongbong Marcos led a happy life with his family, just like any other young person. He completed kindergarten at the Institucion Teresiana and elementary school at La Salle Green Hills in Manila before being sent to England to continue his secondary education at the Worth School, an all-boys Benedictine abbey, and to continue living a better life while his father was previously serving the Philippines.In addition, Bongbong Marcos wants to continue his education; he enrolled at Oxford University in England to complete his undergraduate degree with a Special Diploma in Social Studies; after that, he pursued a Masters in Business Administration at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, USA. He actually has a passion for music, and he frequently participated in all of his late father's projects and events. Bongbong never failed to carry on his father's legacy. He has the utmost respect for what his father accomplished in politics since he was able to see everything in between.And now that Bongbong Marcos is the country's president, he is making sure to provide excellent service to his citizens. He is sincerely prepared to serve the Filipino people with excellence, unity, and integrity with the aid of his well appointed cabinet. He is handling the issues with such optimism, just like his father, as well. Despite all the problems and disagreements, Bongbong Marcos maintains his composure and makes an effort to lead and put the welfare of the group first.And now that Bongbong Marcos is the country's president, he is making sure to provide excellent service to his citizens.

He is handling the issues with such optimism, just like his father, as well. Despite all the problems and disagreements, Bongbong Marcos maintains his composure and makes an effort to lead and put the welfare of the group first.With that said, it can be seen that Bongbong Marcos was very modest with other people, maintaining his manners, and instilling virtues like his late father even before he won the 2021 Presidential election. Bongbong Marcos represents the hope and resiliency that this nation needs, just like the windmills do. That is one of the factors that helps a country develop and achieve sustainable life.​</a>

Sam’s Snail
One fine morning, a boy who goes by Sam was passing through the neighbourhood at 6:30 in the morning to make it to his school early. He was thinking about what the next class pet would be as the last one sadly died of thirst. 
His thoughts were interrupted when he saw a small snail upside-down on the sidewalk. He watched the snail struggle and try it’s best to get back up. Feeling sympathetic, he tipped it over. The snail continued on its way to the busy road. When Sam tried turning the snail around to make it face the grass, it still continued to the road.
Knowing the vehicles on the road could easily squish the puny snail, he decided to simply just bring it with him to school. He grabbed the empty container his mom always packs for him just in case and carefully placed the snail inside. He looked around and noticed a flower bush. He picked a leave and placed it in the container as well.
During class hours, he’d keep the snail’s container on top of his bag as it was full and he had to watch over the little critter. The adviser of his class made her students list down all the presidents of the Philippines they knew. As she was passing by her students, checking if everyone was working, she noticed the snail container on Sam’s bag and stared at it for a few seconds. 
“Sam, may I ask about this snail on top of your bag?” She asked him picking up the container in curiosity. “Teacher, that’s a snail I found going to school this morning, it had a huge risk of dying if he continued going to the busy road so I brought it to school to keep it safe.” Sam answered. “I see…may I speak to you after class?” She looked at him. “Sure ma’am.” Sam went back to listing presidents.
“Sam, I have questions regarding the snail. You know how no one brought a new class pet for us today right?” The teacher said as she pushed her glasses up her nose. “Yes po.” The adviser looked at him, “I would like to ask you if the snail could become the next class pet? We need a replacement for Tom the Tortoise. It’s fine if not.” He thought for a bit and asked himself “Why not?” “Sure teacher, we can make him the class pet.” The adviser’s eyes lit up and a smile crept on her face.
 “Great! Say, what is the name of the little fella?” She asked. “Eum, its name is…Shelly! Shelly the Snail.” Sam blurted out the first thing that came in mind. “Alright, I’ll bring it home and find a proper container for it.”
Since it was almost the end of the school year, Shelly ended up becoming their class pet until the last day of class. During it’s time as class pet, it became so popular it became the school’s new mascot! Who knew a snail found walking to school could achieve so much?</a>

                                            By Mr. Bun D. Tenorio Jr.Lifted from the book The Phoenix World of ReadingI have a story to tell. This is about a young boy I know. He was born poor to parents who were farmers. When he grew up, however, he was able to meet and mingle with kings and queens, presidents, and senators. No magic took place there. This is a real story. Because the kid was poor, he didn’t have a single toy. He would go to his neighbor’s house to use the toys of his playmates. In school, he barely had notebooks. Even if his mother couldn’t afford to buy him notebooks, this kid persevered to study. This boy was poor but rich in fighting spirit. Often he would go to school without allowance, wearing slippers and a tattered uniform. For breakfast, he would fill his glass of coffee with rice. For lunch, he would mash banana and steamed rice. For dinner, he and his brothers would share one fried egg, divided equally among them. One day, he came home with the sole of his foot bleeding. He stepped on a piece of broken glass and it pierced through his worn out slippers. “Nay, please buy me a pair of slippers,” the boy asked his mother. “Son, we don’t have any money. Just be careful the next time.”In time, all his wounds were healed. They left scars all over his body. He graduated from grade school with honors. He continued to study.He could not have studied in high school were if not for the elementary teachers who helped him get a scholarship. This kid was full of ambition, only he had no resources. So he could go to college, his mother offered a novena to God for him to pass the entrance examination of the University of the Philippines. God heard her prayers and this boy got a scholarship. He was given a monthly stipend and a book allowance, which he gave to his mother, so they could have money. Slowly but surely, his dreams were gradually being realized. The kid who imagined that he lived in a sandcastle became a writer. He met, mingled with, and wrote stories of people, the movers and shakers of the world that he thought only existed in the sandcastle of his dreamland.It may sound proud to listen to the story of the kid but this is the truth. He achieved this little success in life because he once dreamed that he would be able to buy pairs and pairs of slippers and shoes, that the wounds of the past would be healed, that there would be food on their table. To this day, this boy continues to dream.I am this kid.Who were the people who helped him pursue his dream in life? 'Where did he live when he was still a kid? Where did he finish his college degree? Where does he presently work?When did the author realize that his family was having financial problems?What particular situations can prove that the boy’s family was really poor?What kind of relationship does the author have with his siblings? Cite the reason behind your conclusion.Why did he not complain after being told by his mother that she couldn’t buy him a new pair of slippers?(The subject is Reading)</a>

Romulo I talked with and write about such men as Colin Kelly, Jr, who sank the 29,000-ton battleship off Luzon, and First Lieutenant Boyd D. Wagner who was attacked by five pursuit planes at Aparri and brought down two of them in the air. Boys like these represented the heroic, helpless stand we were putting up against Japan. But there were humbler figures no less heroic, There was the little Filipino telephone girl in San Fernado, La Union, who refused to leave her switchboard and maintained communication to the last against the oncoming Japanese; and that frail school teacher in Vigan, Ilocos Sur - his name is Buenaventura J. Bello - who refused to remove the American flag from his classroom wall and was shot standing beneath it by Japanese soldiers. My brother-in-law, Alfredo Eugenio, the National Air Raid warden, when I found time to visit him in the hospital, seemed to me a courageous figure.He has taken his air raid duties seriously and burned both hands experimenting with phosphorus. His wife sat beside him night and day, manipulating the phones through which Alfredo issued the signals that kept the city warned of enemy planes. I was a soldier. I learned to work day and night sustained by the catnaps and by sandwiches and coffee wolfed at my desk. I learned how to raise my voice on the telephone so that it could be heard above the exploding bombs. Did I have a home-empty now, in the residential district and a wife and children, hiding in the provinces from the enemy while Christmas was coming on? Source: Ricabar, R. (2005).

By Mr. Bun D. Tenorio Jr.
Lifted from the book The Phoenix World of Reading
I have a story to tell. This is about a young boy I know. He was born poor to parents who were farmers. When he grew up, however, he was able to meet and mingle with kings and queens, presidents, and senators. No magic took place there. This is a real story. Because the kid was poor, he didn’t have a single toy. He would go to his neighbor’s house to use the toys of his playmates. In school, he barely had notebooks. Even if his mother couldn’t afford to buy him notebooks, this kid persevered to study. This boy was poor but rich in fighting spirit. Often he would go to school without allowance, wearing slippers and a tattered uniform. For breakfast, he would fill his glass of coffee with rice. For lunch, he would mash banana and steamed rice. For dinner, he and his brothers would share one fried egg, divided equally among them. One day, he came home with the sole of his foot bleeding. He stepped on a piece of broken glass and it pierced through his worn out slippers. “Nay, please buy me a pair of slippers,” the boy asked his mother. “Son, we don’t have any money. Just be careful the next time.”In time, all his wounds were healed. They left scars all over his body. He graduated from grade school with honors. He continued to study.
He could not have studied in high school were if not for the elementary teachers who helped him get a scholarship. This kid was full of ambition, only he had no resources. So he could go to college, his mother offered a novena to God for him to pass the entrance examination of the University of the Philippines. God heard her prayers and this boy got a scholarship. He was given a monthly stipend and a book allowance, which he gave to his mother, so they could have money. Slowly but surely, his dreams were gradually being realized. The kid who imagined that he lived in a sandcastle became a writer. He met, mingled with, and wrote stories of people, the movers and shakers of the world that he thought only existed in the sandcastle of his dreamland.
It may sound proud to listen to the story of the kid but this is the truth. He achieved this little success in life because he once dreamed that he would be able to buy pairs and pairs of slippers and shoes, that the wounds of the past would be healed, that there would be food on their table. To this day, this boy continues to dream.
I am this kid.

2. What kind of student is he when he was younger?
3. What is the lesson of the story?

Tle little boy and the mom.</strong></p><p><strong>2, He was a student filled with and ambitions and was detemined to make his dreams come true.</strong></p><p><strong>3. the lesson of the story is to never give up and always fight to reach your goal.

                            10. "I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines—Baler. My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education. During those Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, did my family live for years. When I was at the age of five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his own feet as a means of transportation. My classes started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up very early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law."Read the statements below.

George and Mirriam were already married for 17 years. Their eldest is 10 yrs old named Nathan and their youngest is 7 years old named Hannah. They are living in Palawan together with their witty dog, Bantay. While the couple are working, George’s father, Lolo Berting is the one who fetches the two kids at school, while Lola Pasing does the household chores and the cooking. Since Nathan was born, both Lolo Berting and Lola Pasing lived together with George’s family to assist the couple in parenting Hannah and Nathan. Lita was 12 yrs old when she knew that she was adopted. Mr. Benjamin and Mrs. Linda had three kids and all of them were boys. Since the couple wanted to have a baby girl, they decided to adopt, because they were too old to have another baby. It was Lina’s birthday when the couple talked to her and told her the truth. Lina wholeheartedly accepted the truth and embraced Mr. and Mrs. Santos. Lina’s biological parents died on a car accident, that’s why the couple adopted Lina. Major Mark Delos Reyes of the Philippines Army was assigned in the province of Tuguegarao. In the call of duty and service, Maj. Delos Reyes and his wife decided that the whole family will transfer to Tuguegarao where Maj. Delos Reyes was assigned. The next day, they packed all their things and left their home. Joyce is fifth among the 13 children of Mr. and Mrs. Aquino. She was 16 yrs. old and will be a grade 11 student next year. Because of poverty, her parents cannot support her studies anymore. Her father is a farmer and he is the only one who provides for their living. Her aunt was living in Manila and offered her father to support Joyce’s study until she finishes her college. A condition was given to them, though. Joyce will have to stay in Manila and will live with her aunt Tessie and her family​</h2><br />

                            16. Who is the 17th President before his political career?Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos is the lone child of former First Lady Imelda Marcos and late President Ferdinand Marcos, Sr. Before he entered politics, Bongbong Marcos led a happy life with his family, just like any other young person. He completed kindergarten at the Institucion Teresiana and elementary school at La Salle Green Hills in Manila before being sent to England to continue his secondary education at the Worth School, an all-boys Benedictine abbey, and to continue living a better life while his father was previously serving the Philippines.In addition, Bongbong Marcos wants to continue his education; he enrolled at Oxford University in England to complete his undergraduate degree with a Special Diploma in Social Studies; after that, he pursued a Masters in Business Administration at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, USA. He actually has a passion for music, and he frequently participated in all of his late father's projects and events. Bongbong never failed to carry on his father's legacy. He has the utmost respect for what his father accomplished in politics since he was able to see everything in between.And now that Bongbong Marcos is the country's president, he is making sure to provide excellent service to his citizens. He is sincerely prepared to serve the Filipino people with excellence, unity, and integrity with the aid of his well appointed cabinet. He is handling the issues with such optimism, just like his father, as well. Despite all the problems and disagreements, Bongbong Marcos maintains his composure and makes an effort to lead and put the welfare of the group first.And now that Bongbong Marcos is the country's president, he is making sure to provide excellent service to his citizens. He is sincerely prepared to serve the Filipino people with excellence, unity, and integrity with the aid of his well appointed cabinet. He is handling the issues with such optimism, just like his father, as well. Despite all the problems and disagreements, Bongbong Marcos maintains his composure and makes an effort to lead and put the welfare of the group first.With that said, it can be seen that Bongbong Marcos was very modest with other people, maintaining his manners, and instilling virtues like his late father even before he won the 2021 Presidential election. Bongbong Marcos represents the hope and resiliency that this nation needs, just like the windmills do. That is one of the factors that helps a country develop and achieve sustainable life.​</h2><br />

Sam’s Snail
One fine morning, a boy who goes by Sam was passing through the neighbourhood at 6:30 in the morning to make it to his school early. He was thinking about what the next class pet would be as the last one sadly died of thirst. 
His thoughts were interrupted when he saw a small snail upside-down on the sidewalk. He watched the snail struggle and try it’s best to get back up. Feeling sympathetic, he tipped it over. The snail continued on its way to the busy road. When Sam tried turning the snail around to make it face the grass, it still continued to the road.
Knowing the vehicles on the road could easily squish the puny snail, he decided to simply just bring it with him to school. He grabbed the empty container his mom always packs for him just in case and carefully placed the snail inside. He looked around and noticed a flower bush. He picked a leave and placed it in the container as well.
During class hours, he’d keep the snail’s container on top of his bag as it was full and he had to watch over the little critter. The adviser of his class made her students list down all the presidents of the Philippines they knew. As she was passing by her students, checking if everyone was working, she noticed the snail container on Sam’s bag and stared at it for a few seconds. 
“Sam, may I ask about this snail on top of your bag?” She asked him picking up the container in curiosity. “Teacher, that’s a snail I found going to school this morning, it had a huge risk of dying if he continued going to the busy road so I brought it to school to keep it safe.” Sam answered. “I see…may I speak to you after class?” She looked at him. “Sure ma’am.” Sam went back to listing presidents.
“Sam, I have questions regarding the snail. You know how no one brought a new class pet for us today right?” The teacher said as she pushed her glasses up her nose. “Yes po.” The adviser looked at him, “I would like to ask you if the snail could become the next class pet? We need a replacement for Tom the Tortoise. It’s fine if not.” He thought for a bit and asked himself “Why not?” “Sure teacher, we can make him the class pet.” The adviser’s eyes lit up and a smile crept on her face.
 “Great! Say, what is the name of the little fella?” She asked. “Eum, its name is…Shelly! Shelly the Snail.” Sam blurted out the first thing that came in mind. “Alright, I’ll bring it home and find a proper container for it.”
Since it was almost the end of the school year, Shelly ended up becoming their class pet until the last day of class. During it’s time as class pet, it became so popular it became the school’s new mascot! Who knew a snail found walking to school could achieve so much?</h2><br />

                            24. By Mr. Bun D. Tenorio Jr.Lifted from the book The Phoenix World of ReadingI have a story to tell. This is about a young boy I know. He was born poor to parents who were farmers. When he grew up, however, he was able to meet and mingle with kings and queens, presidents, and senators. No magic took place there. This is a real story. Because the kid was poor, he didn’t have a single toy. He would go to his neighbor’s house to use the toys of his playmates. In school, he barely had notebooks. Even if his mother couldn’t afford to buy him notebooks, this kid persevered to study. This boy was poor but rich in fighting spirit. Often he would go to school without allowance, wearing slippers and a tattered uniform. For breakfast, he would fill his glass of coffee with rice. For lunch, he would mash banana and steamed rice. For dinner, he and his brothers would share one fried egg, divided equally among them. One day, he came home with the sole of his foot bleeding. He stepped on a piece of broken glass and it pierced through his worn out slippers. “Nay, please buy me a pair of slippers,” the boy asked his mother. “Son, we don’t have any money. Just be careful the next time.”In time, all his wounds were healed. They left scars all over his body. He graduated from grade school with honors. He continued to study.He could not have studied in high school were if not for the elementary teachers who helped him get a scholarship. This kid was full of ambition, only he had no resources. So he could go to college, his mother offered a novena to God for him to pass the entrance examination of the University of the Philippines. God heard her prayers and this boy got a scholarship. He was given a monthly stipend and a book allowance, which he gave to his mother, so they could have money. Slowly but surely, his dreams were gradually being realized. The kid who imagined that he lived in a sandcastle became a writer. He met, mingled with, and wrote stories of people, the movers and shakers of the world that he thought only existed in the sandcastle of his dreamland.It may sound proud to listen to the story of the kid but this is the truth. He achieved this little success in life because he once dreamed that he would be able to buy pairs and pairs of slippers and shoes, that the wounds of the past would be healed, that there would be food on their table. To this day, this boy continues to dream.I am this kid.Who were the people who helped him pursue his dream in life? 'Where did he live when he was still a kid? Where did he finish his college degree? Where does he presently work?When did the author realize that his family was having financial problems?What particular situations can prove that the boy’s family was really poor?What kind of relationship does the author have with his siblings? Cite the reason behind your conclusion.Why did he not complain after being told by his mother that she couldn’t buy him a new pair of slippers?(The subject is Reading)</h2><br />

                            29. II. Read the following passage and answer the questions that follow Last Man of Bataan (An Excerpt) By: Carlos P. Romulo I talked with and write about such men as Colin Kelly, Jr, who sank the 29,000-ton battleship off Luzon, and First Lieutenant Boyd D. Wagner who was attacked by five pursuit planes at Aparri and brought down two of them in the air. Boys like these represented the heroic, helpless stand we were putting up against Japan. But there were humbler figures no less heroic, There was the little Filipino telephone girl in San Fernado, La Union, who refused to leave her switchboard and maintained communication to the last against the oncoming Japanese; and that frail school teacher in Vigan, Ilocos Sur - his name is Buenaventura J. Bello - who refused to remove the American flag from his classroom wall and was shot standing beneath it by Japanese soldiers. My brother-in-law, Alfredo Eugenio, the National Air Raid warden, when I found time to visit him in the hospital, seemed to me a courageous figure.He has taken his air raid duties seriously and burned both hands experimenting with phosphorus. His wife sat beside him night and day, manipulating the phones through which Alfredo issued the signals that kept the city warned of enemy planes. I was a soldier. I learned to work day and night sustained by the catnaps and by sandwiches and coffee wolfed at my desk. I learned how to raise my voice on the telephone so that it could be heard above the exploding bombs. Did I have a home-empty now, in the residential district and a wife and children, hiding in the provinces from the enemy while Christmas was coming on? Source: Ricabar, R. (2005). Across Culture in Language and Philippine Culture. 8. a. b. 6. Who among the soldiers brought down two pursuit planes? a. Alfredo Eugenio b. Boyd D. Wagner C. Carlos P. Romulo d. Colin Kelly Jr. 7. Which of the following statements best described the school teacher in Vigan? a. The school teacher operated all communications. b. The school teacher led the Filipino soldiers to fight. C. The school teacher fought the Japanese soldiers bravely. d. The school teacher died bravely beneath an American flag. How did Alfredo Eugenio help the Filipinos during the war? He issued signals for the soldiers in Japan. He issued signals for the Japanese planes. C. He issued signals to assist the enemy planes. d. He issued signals to the Filipinos about the enemy planes. 9 Which occasion was the closest to the setting of the narrative? a. Anniversary b. Birthday c. Christmas d. Festival 10. How did the Filipino telephone girl show bravery during the war? a. She removed the flags of Japan in the streets. b. She removed all Japanese soldiers in the nearby area. c. She stayed on her station and fought the Japanese soldiers. d. She stayed on her switchboard to keep the communication open.​</h2><br />
