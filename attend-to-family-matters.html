For the Angeles Family, Mr. Angeles’s homecoming from his periodic inspection trips was an occasion for celebration.
But his homecoming-from a trip to the South-was fated to be more memorable than, say, of the others.
He had written from Mariveles; “I have just met a marvelous mat weaver a real artist-and I shall have a surprise for
you. I asked him to weave a sleeping mat for everyone in the family. He is using many different colors and for each the
dominant color is that of our respective birthstones. I am sure that the children will be very pleased. I know you will be. I can
hardly wait to show them to you.”
Nana Emilia read that letter that morning again and again every time she had a chance to leave the kitchen. In the
evening when all the children were home from school, she asked her oldest son, Jose, to read the letter at dinner table. The
children became very much excited about the mats and talked about them until late into the night. These thoughts made her
wrote her husband. For days after that, mats continued to be the chief topic of conversation among the children.
Mr. Angeles travelled to southern Philippines and brought mats for his wife and children. Each mat has the
corresponding name of all his living offspring, even those who already died. When he arrived home from his trip, he presented
the mats to his family. The sorrow heightened when the last three mats he opened are for his dead children who made his
wife reacted with grief.
At that point, Mr. Angeles cried with pain while telling his wife that the three dull colored mats were for Josefina,
Victoria and Concepcion. He added that his three dead children must always be in their memory no matter where they are
now.

Lastly, enjoy your sandwich, and don’t forget to clean up your mess. 13. Dinosaurs existed about 250 million years ago to 65 million years ago. This era is broken up into three periods known as the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. 14. In some cities, such as San Francisco, earthquakes are so common that millions of dollars in damage are caused by them each year. To help address this issue, some builders create houses, dwellings, and buildings that will not collapse in the event of an earthquake. This process is called seismic design or “earthquake-proofing” and helps to reduce the damage caused by earthquakes. 15. The twist is a dance inspired by rock and roll music. 16. To do the twist, first stand with your feet approximately shoulder width apart. The torso may be squared to the knees and hips, or turned at an angle so one foot is farther forward than the other. Then, hold your arms out from your body, bent at your elbow. Next, rotate your hips, torso, and legs as a single unit with your arms staying more or less stationary. Every so often lift one leg off of the floor for styling. Now you’re doing the twist! 17. Animals who have their two eyes located in front of their face include lions, wolves, and owls and they hunt. Contrarily, animals that are hunted have eyes on the sides of their heads. 18.

Every so often lift one leg off of the floor for styling. Now you’re doing the twist! 17. Animals who have their two eyes located in front of their face include lions, wolves, and owls and they hunt.
