                                            LESSON 2: ART IN THE PHILIPPINES
Filipino Arts are alive and well around the country!
But what exactly are these arts and how do they differ from each other? Who are some of the
notable artists in the Philippines?
Activity 3: The Art Journal
For these next lessons we are going to build your very own ART JOURNAL! As
we learn about the different kinds of art forms and become introduced to some of
our country’s greatest artists, you will build a small compilation of writings, images,
and thoughts to help you build a greater understanding and appreciation of art and
yourself as an artist.
You may use:
• A new or fresh notebook or journal
• A blog or vlog site
• Electronic format like Word document or PowerPoint
• Other mediums like cut outs, collages, or illustrations
• You may use newspapers, magazines, or even the internet
So let’s begin, as your first entry, answer this question:
When you hear the term “Filipino Art” or “Filipino Artists” what comes to mind? List
it down, show us, use words, pictures, drawings, whatever you want! Get creative!
This is your journal</a>

                                            ParagraphDirections: Read and understand the paragraphs below, then answer the questions thatfollow. Write them on the second column.Deforestation is a serious problem because forests and trees aren’t just pretty tolook at, they do an important job making the earth’s environment suitable for life. They clean the air, store water, preserve soil, and provide homes for animals. They also supply food,fuel, wood products, and paper products for humans. In the past fifty years, morethan half of the world’s rainforests have been destroyed. Today, the forests of the world are being cut down at a rate of fifty acres every minute! Scientists say that if deforestationcontinues, the world’s climate may change, floods may become more common, andanimals will die.One solution to the problem of deforestation is to use less paper. If you use lesspaper, fewer trees will be cut for paper making. How can you use less paper? One answeris to reduce your paper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, or write an essay. A second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather than using a new sheet of paper. The backs of old envelopes are perfect for shopping lists orPhone messages and when you write a rought draft of an essay write on back of.AnswerQuestion1.

                            7. LESSON 2: ART IN THE PHILIPPINES
Filipino Arts are alive and well around the country!
But what exactly are these arts and how do they differ from each other? Who are some of the
notable artists in the Philippines?
Activity 3: The Art Journal
For these next lessons we are going to build your very own ART JOURNAL! As
we learn about the different kinds of art forms and become introduced to some of
our country’s greatest artists, you will build a small compilation of writings, images,
and thoughts to help you build a greater understanding and appreciation of art and
yourself as an artist.
You may use:
• A new or fresh notebook or journal
• A blog or vlog site
• Electronic format like Word document or PowerPoint
• Other mediums like cut outs, collages, or illustrations
• You may use newspapers, magazines, or even the internet
So let’s begin, as your first entry, answer this question:
When you hear the term “Filipino Art” or “Filipino Artists” what comes to mind? List
it down, show us, use words, pictures, drawings, whatever you want! Get creative!
This is your journal</h2><br />

                            11. ParagraphDirections: Read and understand the paragraphs below, then answer the questions thatfollow. Write them on the second column.Deforestation is a serious problem because forests and trees aren’t just pretty tolook at, they do an important job making the earth’s environment suitable for life. They clean the air, store water, preserve soil, and provide homes for animals. They also supply food,fuel, wood products, and paper products for humans. In the past fifty years, morethan half of the world’s rainforests have been destroyed. Today, the forests of the world are being cut down at a rate of fifty acres every minute! Scientists say that if deforestationcontinues, the world’s climate may change, floods may become more common, andanimals will die.One solution to the problem of deforestation is to use less paper. If you use lesspaper, fewer trees will be cut for paper making. How can you use less paper? One answeris to reduce your paper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, or write an essay. A second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather than using a new sheet of paper. The backs of old envelopes are perfect for shopping lists orPhone messages and when you write a rought draft of an essay write on back of.AnswerQuestion1.

                            23. deforestation is a serious problem because forests and trees aren’t just pretty to look at, they do an important job making the earth’s environment suitable for life. they clean the air, store water, preserve soil, and provide homes for animals. they also supply food, fuel, wood products, and paper products for humans. in the past fifty years, more than half of the world’s rainforests have been destroyed. today, the forests of the world are being cut down at a rate of fifty acres every minute! scientists say that if deforestation continues, the world’s climate may change, floods may become more common, and animals will die. one solution to the problem of deforestation is to use less paper. if you use less paper, fewer trees will be cut for paper making. how can you use less paper? one answer is to reduce your paper use by using both sides of the paper when you photocopy, write a letter, or write an essay. a second answer is to reuse old paper when you can, rather than using a new sheet of paper. the backs of old envelopes are perfect for shopping lists or phone messages, and when you write a rough draft of an essay, write it on the back of something else. a final answer is to recycle used paper products instead of throwing them away. most schools, offices, and districts have recycling center. if you follow the three rs – reduce, reuse, and recycle –, you can help save the world’s forests
