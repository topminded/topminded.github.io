                                            Effects of Mutations
The majority of 1. (MTTUOIATN) have neither negative nor 2.(PSOTIVIE) effects on
the organism in which they occur. These mutations are called 3.(NURALET) mutations.
Examples include silent point mutations. They are neutral because they do not change the amino
acids in the 4.(PORETINS) they encode.
Some mutations have a positive effect on the organism in which they occur. They are
called 5.(BINEFECAIL) mutations. They lead to new versions of proteins that help organisms
6.(APADT) to changes in their environment. Beneficial mutations are essential for evolution to
occur. They increase an organism's chances of 7.(SIRVUVNIG) or reproducing, so they are likely
to become more common over time.
Imagine making a random change in a complicated machine such as a car engine. The
chance that the random change would improve the functioning of the car is very small. The change
is far more likely to result in a car that does not run well or perhaps does not run at all. In the same
way, any random change in a gene's DNA is likely to result in a protein that does not function
normally or may not function at all. Such mutations are likely to be 8.(HUMARFL). These
mutations may cause genetic disorders or 9.(CERCAN).
Many other mutations have no effect on the organism because they are repaired before
protein synthesis occurs. Cells have multiple 10.(RAPEIR) mechanisms to fix mutations in DNA.</a>

                            6. Effects of Mutations
The majority of 1. (MTTUOIATN) have neither negative nor 2.(PSOTIVIE) effects on
the organism in which they occur. These mutations are called 3.(NURALET) mutations.
Examples include silent point mutations. They are neutral because they do not change the amino
acids in the 4.(PORETINS) they encode.
Some mutations have a positive effect on the organism in which they occur. They are
called 5.(BINEFECAIL) mutations. They lead to new versions of proteins that help organisms
6.(APADT) to changes in their environment. Beneficial mutations are essential for evolution to
occur. They increase an organism's chances of 7.(SIRVUVNIG) or reproducing, so they are likely
to become more common over time.
Imagine making a random change in a complicated machine such as a car engine. The
chance that the random change would improve the functioning of the car is very small. The change
is far more likely to result in a car that does not run well or perhaps does not run at all. In the same
way, any random change in a gene's DNA is likely to result in a protein that does not function
normally or may not function at all. Such mutations are likely to be 8.(HUMARFL). These
mutations may cause genetic disorders or 9.(CERCAN).
Many other mutations have no effect on the organism because they are repaired before
protein synthesis occurs. Cells have multiple 10.(RAPEIR) mechanisms to fix mutations in DNA.</h2><br />
