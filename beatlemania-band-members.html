                            1. Three bands are to march in a parade. The bands have 24, 32, and 40 members. How can the bands arrange  their members so that each of the bands has the same number of members in a row as they march?</h2><br />
                        Find the average members of the band so that it will be the number of members in each band.<br />24+32+40=96/3=32<br /><br />Therefore, each band must have 32 members so that it will be the same number from the other 2 bands. Hope this helps =)40-8=32<br />24+8=32<br />each band should have 32 members<br />
