Culture refers to a group or community which shares common experiences that shape the way its members understand the world. It includes groups that we are born into, such as race, national origin,16gender, class, or religion. It can also include a group we join orbecome part of.2. Culture is a strong part of people's lives. It influences their views, values, humor, hopes, loyalties, worries and fears. It helps to have some perspective and understanding of their cultures.3. Culture and society defined, culture consists of the beliefs, behaviors,objects, and other characteristics common to the members of aparticular group or society.4. Through culture, people and groups define themselves, conform tosociety's shared values, and contribute to society.5. The major elements of culture are symbols, language, norms, values,and artifacts.a. A symbol is anything that is used to stand for something else. People who share a culture often attach a specific meaning to an object, gesture, sound, or image. For example, a cross is a significant symbol to Christians. It is not simply two pieces of wood attached to each other, nor is it just an old object of torture and execution. To Christians, it represents the basis of their entire religion, and they have great reverence for the symbol.b. Language is a system of words and symbols used to communicate with other people.

This idea is the overall concept about the new topic. As the lesson presented, it will give you the meaning of culture like the following:1. Culture refers to a group or community which shares common experiences that shape the way its members understand the world. It includes groups that we are born into, such as race, national origin,16gender, class, or religion. It can also include a group we join orbecome part of.2. Culture is a strong part of people's lives. It influences their views, values, humor, hopes, loyalties, worries and fears. It helps to have some perspective and understanding of their cultures.3. Culture and society defined, culture consists of the beliefs, behaviors,objects, and other characteristics common to the members of aparticular group or society.4. Through culture, people and groups define themselves, conform tosociety's shared values, and contribute to society.5. The major elements of culture are symbols, language, norms, values,and artifacts.a. A symbol is anything that is used to stand for something else. People who share a culture often attach a specific meaning to an object, gesture, sound, or image. For example, a cross is a significant symbol to Christians. It is not simply two pieces of wood attached to each other, nor is it just an old object of torture and execution. To Christians, it represents the basis of their entire religion, and they have great reverence for the symbol.b. Language is a system of words and symbols used to communicate with other people. This includes full languages as we usually think of them, such as English, Spanish, French, etc. but, it also includes body language, slang, and common phrases that are unique to certain groups of people.C. Systems of values are culturally defined standards for what is good or desirable. Members of the culture use the shared system of values to decide what is good and what is bad."​</h2><br />

The body is not an object to be studied in relation to culture, but is to beconsidered as the subject of culture, or in other words as the existential ground ofculture. On the other hand, Geertz (1973) described culture as "a system of inheritedconceptions expressed in symbolic forms by means of which men communicate,perpetuate, and develop their knowledge about and attitudes toward life".The interpretation of the symbols in each culture is essential which gives meaning toone's action.

                        <p>Culture is a complex concept that encompasses many different aspects of human experience. It is shared among members of a particular group or society, and is expressed through various symbolic forms such as language, art, and rituals. Culture is also learned through socialization and is passed down from one generation to the next.</p><p></p><p>The concept of embodiment is also important in understanding culture. This refers to the idea that the human body is not simply an object to be studied, but is the subject of culture and the existential ground of culture. In other words, the body is not just a vessel for culture, but is an active participant in the cultural process.</p><p></p><p>As with any complex concept, there are different ways to approach the study of culture. For example, some anthropologists, like Clifford Geertz, focus on the symbolic forms of culture and the ways in which these symbols give meaning to our actions. Others, like Thomas Csordas, focus on the embodied nature of culture and the ways in which the body is an active participant in the cultural process. Overall, the study of culture is a rich and fascinating field that offers many different perspectives and approaches.</p><br />
