                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>A. COMPENSATION<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In brain science, <strong>compensation </strong>is a system by which one covers up, deliberately or unknowingly, shortcomings, dissatisfactions, wants, or insecurities or ineptitude in one life region through the satisfaction or greatness in another space. <strong>Compensation </strong>can conceal either genuine or envisioned inadequacies and individual or actual mediocrity. Positive <strong>compensations </strong>might assist one with defeating one's troubles. Then again, pessimistic <strong>compensations </strong>don't, which brings about a supported sensation of mediocrity.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Compensation</strong> might pay attention to the guidance of an apparent insufficiency, as when a youth dread of water is over-remunerated by a fixation on cruising, or a unique anxiety toward picture books by an emphasis on writing. Or then again it could be against the first trouble spot, as when youth rage turns into a shaky grown-up pacifism or distracting to it, as while wearing shortcoming is made up for by scholarly strivings.</p><p></p><p>what is compensation - Brainly.ph
