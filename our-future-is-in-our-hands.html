In life, there are people that will hurt us and cause us pain, but we must learn to forgive and forget and not hold grudges.
In life, there are imperfections we will make, but we must learn from our mistakes and grow from them.
In life, there are regrets we will have to live with, but we must learn to leave the past behind and realize it is something we can't change.
In life, there are people we will lose forever and can't have back, but we must learn to let go and move on.
In life, there are obstacles that will cause interference, but we must learn to overcome these challenges and grow stronger.
In life, there are fears that will hold us back from what we want, but we must learn to fight them with the courage from within.
God holds our lives in his hands. He holds the key to our future. Only he knows our fate.
He sees everything and knows everything. Everything in life really does happen for a reason: "God's Reason".</a>

But effective forecasting provides essential context that informs your intuition. It broadens your understanding by revealing overlooked possibilities and exposing unexamined assumptions regarding hoped-for outcomes. At the same time, it narrows the decision space within which you must exercise your intuition.</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>sana maka tulong.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>hope it helps ^^</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>The 3 Things We Must Do: 1. Produce More Food on Less LandIcon of South America with a mark over Brazil. It's next to a graphic of crops with an arrow pointing to ideal land.TARGETED AGRICULTURAL EXPANSION Identify areas where crops grow best to avoid destroying nature.Problem:Today’s version of large-scale agriculture is the biggest source of land conversion, drives deforestation that worsens climate change, uses 70% of the world’s freshwater supply and relies on fertilizer practices that pollute our waters. As the need to feed a billion more people increases, agricultural expansion could devastate habitats, release even more carbon into the atmosphere, and dry up rivers.<p></p><p>2. Eliminate Overfishing</p><p>Icon of Southeast Asia with a mark over Indonesia. It's next to a graphic of a boat with a fishing line pointing towards one fish species, while another fish species swims away.</p><p>TARGETED FISHING Use technology to catch only the right species.</p>Problem:Overfishing and poor fisheries management is not only devastating to the fish species being pushed to the brink of collapse. It endangers food webs and ocean ecosystems by disrupting the balance of all sea life. And it threatens billions of people who rely on seafood as an important source of livelihood and animal protein. Without serious changes, 84% of the world’s fish stocks will be in peril in our lifetime.<p></p>3. Increase Clean EnergyIcon of the United States with a mark over Nevada. It's next to a graphic of mountains and forest next to cleared land with solar panels and wind turbines.TARGETED ENERGY SITING Use already degraded land for energy development.<p>Problem:</p>Climate change is the single most serious threat facing our planet today. We must reduce carbon emissions to, or below, levels agreed to in the Paris Climate Agreement to prevent catastrophic harm. And with global energy demand expected to increase 56% over the next couple decades, it will be impossible to meet those emissions targets if we stick primarily with traditional fossil fuels.<p></p><br />

In life, there are people we will lose forever and can't have back, but we must learn to let go and move on.
In life, there are obstacles that will cause interference, but we must learn to overcome these challenges and grow stronger.
In life, there are fears that will hold us back from what we want, but we must learn to fight them with the courage from within.
