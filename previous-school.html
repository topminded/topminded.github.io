                        <p></p><p> I can provide you with some general insights about how the current school year may be similar or different from the previous school year.</p><p></p>Similarities:<p>___________________________________</p><p></p><p><strong>Academic calendar:</strong> The academic calendar may be similar to the previous school year, with the same start and end dates, holidays, and breaks.</p><p></p><p><strong>Curriculum:</strong> The curriculum may be similar, with students covering the same subjects or topics as the previous year.</p><p></p><p><strong>Classroom setup:</strong> The classroom setup, such as desks, chairs, and teaching aids, may be similar to the previous year.</p><p></p><p><strong>Extracurricular activities:</strong> The extracurricular activities may be similar to the previous year, with students participating in the same sports, clubs, or events.</p><p></p>Differences:<p>___________________________________</p><p></p><p><strong>Learning format:</strong> The biggest difference between the current school year and the previous year is the learning format. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many schools have switched to hybrid or fully remote learning, which was not the case in the previous year.</p><p></p><p><strong>Teaching methods:</strong> Teachers may have adapted their teaching methods to better accommodate remote or hybrid learning. For example, they may use more technology or offer more online resources.</p><p></p><p><strong>Safety protocols:</strong> Schools may have implemented new safety protocols to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. This could include mandatory mask-wearing, increased cleaning and disinfecting, and social distancing measures.</p><p></p><p><strong>Student engagement:</strong> The pandemic has made it more challenging for students to stay engaged and motivated. Teachers may need to find new ways to keep students engaged and motivated in a remote or hybrid learning environment.</p><p></p><p>In summary, while there are some similarities between the current school year and the previous year, the biggest difference is the learning format due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Schools and teachers have had to adapt their teaching methods and safety protocols to ensure students can continue learning in a safe and effective manner.</p><p>l</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My expectation for the school year 2021-2022 is about prosperous knowledge and genuine companionship with my classmates. Learning became extra challenging because of many changes that happened in learning system due to the global pandemic that is why I’m expecting myself this school year 2021-2022 to be more persevere, determined and motivated. I’m also expecting this school year to teach me different kinds of knowledge, first the academic learning from my subjects and teachers, and also the emotional capacity and knowledge to be emotionally firm to adjust and conquer all the challenges that I will face for the 2021-2022 school year. I’m expecting my new teachers this school year to be kind enough and patient to provide their student the best quality of education they can provide. I expect my teachers to be whole-heatedly dedicated to their duties. I expect them to be kind enough to understand the weaknesses of each of their students. For my classmates, I expect them to crave knowledge and to study at best as they could. Thus, I expect this school year to be wealthy in knowledge and for everyone to be generous to share their knowledge to everyone, and also to support one another.</p><br />

                                            <h2 class="ez-toc-section" id="lessons-that-you-have-learned-from-your-previous-experiences-at-school%e2%80%8b">
                            13. Lessons that you have learned from your previous experiences at school​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>What do you learn from your past experience?</p><p>Learn from the past means that when you start something new, it's important for you to understand and reference previous experiences. Your present thinking is informed by past thinking. You'll be conscious of past successes and failures in your own ventures, your company's, and those of historical figures in society.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>10. Structure Is Critical</p><p>Some students will initially reject a structured classroom, but ultimately they will come to enjoy it and even crave it when it is not there. A structured classroom is a safe classroom where teaching and learning are maximized. Providing students with a structured learning environment can show students that having structure in their life is a positive aspect that they need more of.</p><p></p><p></p><p>9. You Have the Greatest Control of Your Destiny</p><p>Many people believe that their destiny is dictated by the situation in which they inherited by birth. Nothing could be further from the truth. Every person controls his own destiny once they reach a certain age. Teachers fight this misconception all the time. For example, many students believe that they cannot go to college because their parents did not go to college. This is a cycle that schools work hard to break.</p><p></p><p>8. Mistakes Provide Valuable Learning Opportunities</p><p>The greatest lessons in life result because of failures and it is the lessons learned from those mistakes that help make us whom we become. Teachers teach this life lesson on a daily basis. No student is perfect. They make mistakes, and it is a teacher's job to ensure that their students understand what the mistake was, how to fix it, and to give them strategies to ensure that those mistakes are not repeated.</p><p></p><p>7. Respect Has to Be Given to Be Received</p><p>Good teachers lead by example. They give their students respect knowing that the majority of the students will, in turn, give them respect back. Teachers often have students who come from backgrounds where little respect is expected or given in the home. School may be the only place where respect is given and expected to be given back.</p><p></p><p>6. Differences Should Be Embraced</p><p>Bullying is one of the largest problems in schools today often resulting because of perceived differences that make some students an easy target based on how they look or act. The world is full of unique and different people. These differences, no matter what they are, should be embraced and accepted. Many schools now incorporate learning opportunities into their daily lessons to teach kids how to respect individual differences.</p><p></p><p>5. There Are Aspects of Life That Are Beyond Our Control</p><p>The process of school is one big lesson on this. Many students, especially older ones, do not want to go to school but go because they are required by law. Once they get there, they are learning lessons created by a teacher with little to no student ownership. These lessons are being taught because of state-directed standards. Life is no different. There are many aspects of our life with which we have little control.</p><p></p><p>4. Bad Decisions Lead to Serious Consequences</p><p>Not every poor decision will lead to a bad consequence, but some of them will. You may get away with something once or twice, but you will eventually be caught. Decision making is a critical life lesson. Students should be taught to think each decision through, never make a decision in haste, and be prepared to live with the consequences associated with that decision.</p><p></p><p>3. Good Decisions Lead to Prosperity</p><p>Making smart decisions is critical to individual success. A series of poor decisions can quickly lead to a road of failure. Making a good decision does not necessarily mean it is the easiest decision. In some cases, it is going to be the harder decision. Students must be rewarded, recognized, and praised for good decision making as often as possible. Teachers can help make good decision making a habit that will follow students throughout their life.</p><p></p><p>2. Working Together Cooperatively Benefits Everyone</p><p>Teamwork is a valuable skill taught in schools. Schools often provide the first opportunities for children to work together with other children who may be different. Working cooperatively is imperative to both team and individual success. Students must be taught that each individual part working together makes the team successful. However, if one part quits or does not perform adequately, everyone fails.</p><p></p><p>1. You Can Become Anything</p><p>It is cliché, but it is also a valuable lesson that teachers must never stop teaching. As adults, we know that it is nearly impossible to break a generational rut. However, we should never give up hope that we can reach students and help them break a cycle that has held other family members back for many generations. It is our basic duty to provide hope and belief that they can achieve and become anything.<br /><br /><br />pa follow po at brainlies ty po</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>(This is the last post in a three-part series. You can see Part One here and Part Two here.)</p><p></p><p>The new “question-of-the-week” is:</p><p></p><p>What was the best moment you ever had in the classroom?</p><p></p><p>In Part One, Jen Schwanke, Amy Sandvold, Anne Jenks, and Sarah Thomas shared their top moments. You can listen to a 10-minute conversation I had with them on my BAM! Radio Show. You can also find a list of, and links to, previous shows here. In Part Two, Meghan Everette, Jeryl-Ann Asaro, Jeffery Galle, and Kara Vandas shared their memories. I also included comments from readers.</p><p></p><p>Those first two posts offered the teacher perspective. Today, five students from my classes contribute short pieces about their favorite moments, and what others might be able to learn from them.</p><p></p><p>You might also be interested in these two other posts:</p><p></p><p>Students Describe Their Favorite Teachers</p><p></p><p>‘He Was a Very Good Listener’ - Students Write About Their Most Memorable Teachers</p><p></p><p>Response From Leslie Servin</p><p></p><p>During my time in high school I had it really good moments, but my best moments that I’ve experienced are in a particular class during my senior year, in Sacramento, Calif. So I was basically a new student in these kind of classes and also I’m English learner. I remember my first presentation in this class. I didn’t want to do it, but finally I did it and that one was my best moment. When I went to present I felt afraid, and then when I presented I felt so good for the effort I applied on. Now I feel so much better than my first day of presentations because I now know that I can do whatever I want to do. The learnings that I acquire made it so good this moment because I know that I have to trust on me. Something teachers or students can learn from my experience is that we have to overcome our fears and not let them control ourselves because we can’t know our capabilities if we are afraid.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

The work is hard and some students may experience their first low grades. Most students have done well in high school. Some high school courses are not as demanding as college. A student has to learn a particular professor’s expectations and style of grading.</p><p></p><p>6. Students will be expected to maintain their own schedules and develop good study habits. There is no one around to force the student to study, to go to class, or to get a good night’s sleep. Students have to create a structure that works for them. Time management is a skill that can be learned or improved through work with the Macalester Academic Excellence (MAX) Center (phone number is 651-696-6121).</p><p></p><p>7.

This guide covers different ways everyone in the school community can prepare for various natural disasters and other emergencies to stay safe.</p><p></p><p>Is Your School at Risk? A Look at Natural Disasters</p><p></p><p>Some natural disasters can be predicted, giving schools enough warning to evacuate or take other safety precautions, but others can happen unexpectedly or go through rapid changes that suddenly put a school in danger. The first step schools should take in preparing for these types of emergencies is to assess the natural disaster risks in their areas.
